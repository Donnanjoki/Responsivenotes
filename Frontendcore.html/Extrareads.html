                  Topic:all vs root vs html vs body selectors
From: https://blog.timonwa.com/all-vs-root-vs-html-vs-body-selectors

>. All these are CSS Selectors, which are used to select elements in our HTML document.
  
     1] The * universal selector

>.This selectors, selects all the elements in your html page.
>. It is used to give universal styles to all elements.
>. It can also be used to select all descendant elements within a particular element.
>. Its used to create CSS resets.
>. It can be overridden by other element styles.

    2]] The :root selector

>. This is a pseudo-class selector. It selects and reps the root element of your document.
>. Note the html element selector and :root selector are not the same.
>. It represents the root parent of your document, hence this document does not have to be a HTML doc, it can be an XML, XHTML, SVG tag e.t.c depending on
what document you are styling with CSS.
>. This has a higher specificity that html element selector.
>. It is additionally used to declare global variables.


    3]] html element Selector

>. This selector reps the root element of an HTML document.
>. It has two child elements, that is the head element and the body element.
>. Some styles declared in it can be inherited by its descendants and can be overridden by them.
>. It is not recommended to apply styles to the html element because they will be overridden by the 
body element styles and any other element in the document.
>. An exception to this could be declaring font styles that will be inherited by all its descendant elements, e.g font -size.
This is because the html element selector as the root element, has the rem(root em unit) sizing of any element based on whatever font size set for the element.
>. Another reason is the body element tends to take up all the space in the html document, hence it would be futile to style up
 the html document as the body element will eventually cover it up in the browser.

      4]] The body element selector

>. This contains all the elements that we see in our browser.
>.The only difference between the body and the html element is that the body element has a higher specificity than the html element selector.
>. Hence whichever style you have in the body element will override any replicate style in the html element. Also its styles can be overridden by the element styles within it.
>.It's better to declare styles in the body than in the html.

From: https://wpengine.com/resources/choose-css-unit-create-better-site-layouts-how-to/

              Types of CSS Units

1. Absolute Units
2. Font relative units
3. viewport relative units


      1]] Absolute Units

>. These units depend on DPI (dots per inch) of screens as they vary depending on different screen resolutions. And
are not affected by screen size.
>. They include:
  a] px (pixels)
  b] in (inches)
  c] cm (centimeter)
  d] mm (millimeter)
  e] pc (picas)
  f] pt(points)


      2]] Font Relative Units

>. These units depend on the font size or font family of the document or its parent level elements.
>. They include:
    a] em
    b] rem
    c] ex
    d] ch


       3]] Viewport Relative Units

>. These units depend on the viewport height and width size, such as 
     a] vh (viewport height)
     b] vw (viewport width)
     c] vmin (viewport minimum)
     d] vmax (viewport maximum)



       4]] Percentage

>. The percentage unit (%) does not belong to the listed category above but it can be categorized as a 
relative unit, as it is relative to its parent element.
>.It is primarily associated with height and width of an element, but can also be used anywhere CSS length unit are allowed.

>. It comes in handy for creating a responsive or fluid layout.
> Popular frameworks such as Bootstrap, foundation and Bulma use percentage for their base layout.
