*************************** Principles - standards and checks *******************************

>. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines for digital accessibility includes;

    1]] Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG
    2]] Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG
    3]] User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG


################ POUR Principles ######################################

>. The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines four principles:

   1]] Perceivable - information can be presented in different ways; for example, in braille, different text sizes, text-to-speech, or symbols, etc
   2]] Operable - Functionality can be used in different modalities; for example, keyboard, mouse, sip-and puff, speech input, torch
   3]] Understandable -  information and functionality is understandable; for example consistent navigation, simple language, etc
   4]] Robust - content can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of browsers, media players, and
                assistive technologies.


There are currently two stable versions of WCAG that are both supported by W3C:

   A]] WCAG 2.0 was published in December 2008, and has become widely adopted as the standard for web accessibility by many businesses and governments around the world.
            >. It defines 12 guidelines under the four POUR principles.
            >. Under each Guideline there are more specific Success Criteria divided into three Conformance Levels: A, AA, and AAA. WCAG 2.0 defines 61 Success Criteria.
   B]] WCAG 2.1 was published in June 2018, to better address accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, people with low vision, and people with disabilities using mobile devices. 
            >. WCAG 2.1 is fully backward compatible with WCAG 2.0, so that if your content conforms to WCAG 2.1 it also conforms to WCAG 2.0.
            >. WCAG 2.1 defines 13 Guidelines and 78 Success Criteria.

>.Many policies require conformance to WCAG Level AA.
>. WCAG is a normative W3C web standard called W3C Recommendation. It is designed to be technology-agnostic so that it applies to different technologies. 
>. For example, WCAG does not specify how to code a heading, list, or table. Instead, it requires that such structures are present. 
>. This allows WCAG to be applicable to a wide range of technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as many types of mobile apps, electronic documents, and other digital content.


>. WCAG is supported by non-normative (informative) technical guidance. These are not W3C web standards and can therefore be more regularly updated,
>. They include; 

     1]] Understanding WCAG 2 provides background and explanation of the requirements, such as who it benefits and examples. It is a very useful resource for people learning the standard.
     2]] Techniques for WCAG 2 provides documented ways of meeting the Success Criteria defined by WCAG, advisory good practice, as well as commonly encountered failures in accessibility.
     3]] How to Meet WCAG 2 (sometimes called Quick Reference) brings all this information together in a dynamic widget with filters to help you select only the information you currently need.



################ Harmonized Standards ###############################

>. With the world becoming globally connected, more so in the digital space there is need to harmonize technical standards for web accessibility,
as it not only reduces confusion and strenuous work to the developers but also saves a lot of time for organizations'
as they are able to focus on business needs rather than implementation of accessibility.

>. By many businesses and governments adopting WCAG s the international standard for web accessibility;
  This development helps increase the awareness of accessibility, the support for accessibility in mainstream products and services, and accelerates the implementation of accessibility.

?>>>>>>>>>>>>The WCAG PROCESS <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>. W3C web standards, called Recommendations, are developed transparently in an open collaborative space. 
>. The W3C Process defines specific roles and responsibilities in working groups, as well as mechanisms for conflict resolution and consensus building.

>. Those involved include;
       1]] People with disabilities and organizations representing people with disabilities
       2]] Industry, including large, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and independent consultants
       3]]  Public bodies and other governmental agencies
       4]] Researchers, including industrial and applied research
       5]] Educators, including formal education and business training

######################### Principle 1: Perceivable ##############################################

\





>>>>>>>>>>>> Text Alternatives <<<<<<<<<<<

>.Text alternatives is a foundational aspect of digital accessibility. There are typically many graphical and non-text objects on the screen, such as images, buttons, form controls. 
>. These need text alternatives, which are read aloud by screen readers or used by speech input to activate links.

>. Text alternative: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.

>. Types of images may include: 
    1] Pictures of people, and places
    2] Charts, diagrams, and other infographics
    3] Buttons and other actionable objects
    4] Decoration and illustrative images

>. Each of these needs a text alternative that conveys the purpose of the image. That is, the information that the image is communicating visually, or that function that it provides to the user.

>. Examples include;
    >. Functional Images such as that of a logo(in this case WAI text logo) the text alternative can read - "Web Accessibility initiative homepage."
    >. Decorative images: Often images are used purely for visual decoration, and do not provide information or functionality.
                          such as a visual separator - here such images need to have an empty text alternative.
                          This communicates to assistive technologies that it is safe to ignore this image.
                          >. Note: do not that you forgot to add the text alternative.


>.Many tools do other the functionality of adding text alternatives into your content such as 
   Microsoft Word and Google Docs, social media sites like Instagram and X and CMS like Drupal, WordPress.

>. In HTML, a common way of providing text alternatives is to use the alt attribute of the img element. 
Such alt-text should be short and succinct.

>. There are other methods you can use when you need to provide long descriptions, for example for a chart, diagram, or other infographic.

>. Before evaluating non-text content like an image the first step is to think about its purpose,
   is it;
   a]] Decorative - if the non-text content is decorative you need to hide it from assistive technology devices
                  - These images need to have an empty text alternative to achieve this.
   b]] informative - make sure your alternative text is meaningful, descriptive, and does not repeat.
   c]] Actionable - provide information about the function of the image instead of describing the image. 
                   - Screen reader users, Braille output device users, and people using speech input should all be able to trigger a link or click a button by their various assistive technology devices.
                   - Alternative text on an image helps a user know what link or button they are triggering.





 Tools to use;   WAVE® is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. 
                WAVE can identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Time-based Media <<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>. Time-based media refers to content that is dependent on time. The purpose of this check is to make sure people have access to time-based and synchronized media using alternative formats.

>. This includes media such as;
      >> audion-only files - example podcasts
      >> Video-only files - example silent video tour of a property
      >> video plus audion - example movies
      >> slideshows and presentations with visual and/or audio information that is time-based.


### Alternatives for time-based media ####

    A]] Captions

>. Captions are text synchronized with the multimedia for people who cannot hear the spoken words. People often confuse “captions” and “subtitles,” but they are not the same thing. 
>. Both are text synchronized with the words in a video and both often appear in the same location in the media (usually the bottom of the screen). 
>. Captions should remain verbatim like a literal translation, so clarifications beyond the audio information is not necessary.
>. Sound effects like an opening door or footsteps, should be included in captions when they are relevant.
>. Music, like background music, is important to capture when they are relevant.
>. Similarly, laughter laughter or applause, is important to capture when they are relevant.
>. Speaker identification needs captions, especially if there are several people in the video and it is not clear who is speaking.


>. However captions can be thought of as a transcription of dialogue for people who are Deaf and hard-of-hearing, while subtitles are essentially helper text for people who can hear the 
   audio but may not understand what was said (ex. garbled speech or words spoken in a language you don’t understand).
>. Captions come in two forms: open or closed. Closed captioning can be turned off by the viewer with a click of a button, while open captions are
   essentially burned into the video and cannot be turned off.

    B]] Transcripts

>. Transcripts are the full text of the spoken words and important visual information in the media file, to read as an alternative to watching or listening to the media file. 
>. Transcripts are text-based documents that serve as an alternative to information presented in an audible and visual format.
>. They are similar to captions, but they take the experience to the next level by including important sound effects and other significant visual descriptions (ex. describing eerie sounds in the background). 

    C]] Audio Descriptions

>. Audio descriptions are a version of the multimedia file that includes a narrator explaining important visual information - such as unspoken actions and events - 
   for the benefit of people who cannot see what’s happening on the screen
>. Audio descriptions, unlike captions and transcripts, are a recording of a person explaining the visual aspects of the video that aren’t in the video’s original dialog or narration (ex. describing facial expressions or scenery). 
>. Audio descriptions should convey visual information verbally–that dialogue and other sounds cannot.

    D]] Sign Language

>. Sign language interpretation for multimedia is when you add a video of an interpreter, sometimes shown in a box to the side of the video, who narrates the audio portion through sign language. 
>. Sign language interpretation is often more expressive than just written transcripts, so can provide a much richer experience than captions or transcripts alone.



>>>>>>>>>>>>> Adaptable Content <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>.  WCAG Guideline on adaptable content -     Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.

>. To meet this guideline, it is important that structures such as headings and lists are correctly coded as such.

>. Lookout for the structures when you are creating digital content using word processors, content management systems, and other content editors

>>>>>>>>.. Check basic structure of a site:
   
    >. Components to look for in a basic structure: 
      Headings, Lists, Tables and reading flow
    >. Page titles are not found on the actual webpage, but in the browser tab, so they do not factor into the webpage structure.

   >. To get a basic structure view of the page, you need to turn off images and shows text alternatives, turn off style sheets 
   which specifies how the page is displayed with layout, colors, etc. 
   >. Linearize the page or the tables so that they appear in a single column.
   >. Who does this help? People using screen readers, people using Braille, people with low vision, and people who need to customize how content is presented.


>. "Disabling Styles" will allow you to see the underlying structure and order of the content.
>. This can help identify potential issues with how the content can be displayed in different ways to a variety of people. 
>. When viewing the linearized page, you can check that the information makes sense when read in the order it is shown.

Example: An h1's job is to tell the user what the webpage is about. In most cases, there is only one "main point" of the webpage - so only h1 is needed. 
>. Screen reader users don't care about your website's style - they care about the underlying structure.
>. A webpage needs to have different levels of headings so the reader knows what is the main idea, followed by the secondary idea, and so on. 



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Distinguishable Content <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>. This check is concerned with making the default presentation as easy to perceive as possible to people with disabilities.
>. WCAG guideline states -     Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.

>. Examples of making content distinguishable include:

    1]] Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or identifying content
    2]] Default foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast
    3]] When users resize text up to 200% or change text spacing, no information is lost
    4]] Text reflows in small windows (“viewports”) and when users make the text larger
    5]] Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or avoided where possible
    6]] Users can pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that is played on a website
    7]] Background audio is low or can be turned off, to avoid interference or distraction





### Do not rely on color alone ###

>. Some people perceive colors differently or not at all. Providing instructions like "complete all fields marked in red" is not sufficient 
   because some people will not find these form fields marked in red. 
>. In addition to or instead of using color, you need to use another identifier that does not rely on using color alone. This can be simply adding an asterisk next to the field:




### Provide sufficient contrast ###

>. Providing sufficient contrast between foreground and background color - (contrast ratio) is paramount.
>. The contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 for regular-sized text and ideally 7:1(for headings and titles)  for text. For graphical objects, such as charts, and for large text, a contrast ratio of 3:1 may be sufficient.
>. There are several tools to help you calculate the contrast ratio and select appropriate color combinations. such as >>>> color contrast checker





### Support Content resizing ###

>. many people need to change the size of text. Either by using assistive technologies such as screen magnification too, or changing other
  aspects of text presentation including color, spacing, and font type, to make it easier for them to read. 
>. This may not be related to vision acuity but to how people process visual information,
>. Yet unfortunately designs often break when text size is increased or when the page is magnified. 
   For example, content starts to overlap so that important information becomes unreadable, or functionality becomes unusable.
   >. Most people cannot effectively read text that requires horizontal scrolling And for some, it becomes impossible.

>. An indication of good design is that information is not lost when the text size is changed.




### Ensure control of audio ###

>. Not only visual information needs to be distinguishable but also audio. Imagine a website or app that automatically starts playing music. 
>. If audio is playing for longer than 3 seconds, then users need to be able to pause or stop the audio, or lower the volume of the audio playing.
>.  It is also important to remember that some people with hearing disabilities need clear audio to understand the information, and need to be able to turn off background audio if it is too loud.

>. For videos on websites, it is important that the user has control over the sound so it doesn't interfere with assistive technology device users.
   >. hence the need to provide a control to turn of pause or adjust the video





###############################Principle 2: Operable #################################################



********************** Keyboard Accessible ********************************

>. The keyboard is for many people the primary or only way of using the computer.
>. If all functionality of a webpage works using only a keyboard, that means it can also be used by people using speech input (which creates keyboard input), 
   by mouse (using on-screen keyboards), and by a wide variety of assistive technologies.
>. There should be multiple input modalities for each element on a webpage - you should not require a user to use only one method.

>.WCAG guideline: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

>. Some people use specialized keyboards with ergonomic layouts, on-screen keyboards, or switch devices.
>. Others use the keyboard through speech input or other means of interaction, such as brain computer interfaces.

>. Hence the importance of ensuring that all functionality is accessible from the keyboard - hence a functionality should not require a mouse.

>> Elements that should have keyboard access and visual focus include; links, form elements, media controls and modals.
>. Many people can benefit from keyboard functionality such as;
      1] People with attention disorders
      2] People with cognitive and short-term memory issues
      3] People with visual impairments
      4] People with mobility impairments
      5] People using assistive technologies and strategies that rely on keyboard commands.
      6] People who rely on the keyboard to operate the page,

            >> Keyboard traps <<<<

>. These are either elements where the keyboard cannot access - for instance a tooltip that relies on hover
or elements where keyboard cannot escape - for example a modal pop-up with no options to close.


>. Besides every active element being keyboard accessible, the keyboard focus should be visible at all times and should follow a logical order
through the page elements.
>. It is important for users to know where they are on a page at all times.

           >>> Tests for keyboard and visual focus <<<

1. Tab to all                             5. Functionality
2. Tab away                                6. Drop-downs
3. Tab order
4. Visual focus






********************** Enough Time *****************************************

>.WCAG Guideline:     Provide users enough time to read and use content. 

>. It is important to remember that some people need more time to read and use the content.
>. Example, it may take more time for someone with a learning disability to read text, and for someone using a switch control to complete a form. 

>. Providing clear information about the available time and instructions for extending it is essential for many people.

>. Another related issue is content that continually moves, blinks, scrolls, or updates automatically.
>. This can be a carousel component on a page - a series of images and text that rotate at regular intervals. 
>. Often these components are fairly large and change quickly - this can be very distracting for many people

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Examples of providing enough time include providing mechanisms to:
   
    1]] Stop, extend, or adjust time limits, except where necessary
   2]]  Pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content
   3]]  Postpone or suppress interruptions, except where necessary
   4]]  Re-authenticate when a session expires without losing data




***************** Avoid seizures and Physical reactions ********************

>>. WCAG Guideline:  Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.

>. Content should not flash or blink at a rate of more than three times per second.
>. Content that covers a large area of the screen, and is very bright.
>. This is because for some users, flashing and blinking content can trigger a seizure or photosensitive reactions.

>. Flashing content is ideally avoided entirely or only used in a way that does not cause known risks.
>. Some animations and moving content can also cause discomfort, nausea, and other physical reactions.

>. Animated media must not auto-play for more than five seconds. 
  If you plan to have animations go on longer than five seconds or play on an infinite loop, provide a way for users to pause the animation
>. An animation that cannot be paused can be extremely distracting for people with different types of cognitive disabilities.

>>>>>. example of moving, flashing, or blinking content on websites and apps. Some examples include: carousels, slideshows, SVGs, Gifs, videos, and endless scrolling. 
>. Who does this help??

      1]] people who have seizures or migraines when viewing flashing or blinking material
      2]] people who have vertigo or get nauseous when viewing moving content
      3]] people who have difficulty tracking moving objects
      4]] people with attention deficit disorders.
     
>.No matter the case users need to be able to control moving content and choose what works best such as 
   utilizing media queries like "prefers reduced motion".

   >. Tool to use; Trace Center's photosensitive epilepsy analysis tool or PEAT








*********************** Navigable Content *******************************

>. WCAG Guideline: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

>. Good structures help support effective navigation, hence aiding users who utilize assistive technologies to
manoeuver through the web.

>. Hence since most people navigate web content in various ways its fittingly fair to ensure more structure and semantics
is provided in the content to make it more navigable.

>. This can be done through providing headings and labels to the content or using useful filename or good naming system.
>. Headings give an assistive technology device user more information about the structure of the page and can allow them 
  to navigate to sections of the webpage that they want to know more about.
>. Additionally there should be a focus indicator to guide users on where they are on the webpage.


>. Web page titles should reflect the content and purpose of the page.

>. Page titles must be descriptive.
>. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation to help people know where they are and move between pages in their browser
>. Who does this help???
         1]] people using screen readers
         2]] people using Braille
         3]] people with visual disabilities
         4]] people with cognitive disabilities
         5]] limited short-term memory and reading disabilities,
         6]] people using speech input.

>. Page titles are also used by search engines and used for browser bookmarks and favorites
>. It is important to front-load important information on a page title. 
>. Unless you add more information programmatically, you should avoid link text that does not give context to where the link is going.
>. While contact information is certainly important for your users, links, site maps, and a search feature are critical to finding information on a website.




*********************** Input Modalities *******************************

>. WCAG Guideline:  Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard.

>. People use many more modalities apart from keyboard and mouse to interact with computers and the Web - such as touch screens, voice commands, 
>. These include; touch screens, Information stands at train stations, airports, and other public spaces commonly use touch screens. 
>. Also gestures, like shaking, tapping, or moving your mobile phone or smart watch to activate functions have become quite common.

>. They key aspect is to design functionality in such a way so that it accepts input from a variety of different input modalities.
>. Input modalities beyond keyboard, such as touch activation, voice recognition (speech input), and gestures make content easier to use for many people. 



>> Design considerations that maximize the benefit of input modalities

    1]] Gestures that require dexterity or fine movement have alternatives that do not require high dexterity
    2]] Components are designed to avoid accidental activation, for example by providing undo functionality
    3]] Labels presented to users match corresponding object names in the code, to support activation by voice
    4]] Functionality that is activated by movement can also be activated through user interface components
    5]] Buttons, links, and other active components are large enough to make them easier to activate by touch

>. People who have motor issues are the target audience for increasing the touchable areas on functional elements.
>. Note: The visual text is important, because that is the command that will be spoken by a user using voice input. 
>. If the image visually had the words "go" but programmatically it said "checkout" the voice command could fail.






################################ Principle 3: Understandable #########################################

>. A first step to making your content more understandable to everyone, is to make it more readable.

>. This includes aspects such as:

            1]] Identifying the primary language of pages and of page parts
            2]] Explaining abbreviations, unusual words, and phrases
            3]] Using simple language or providing simplified alternatives


###### Supporting Language #########

>. Just like in many word processors, you can also set the default language of your content in HTML. 
>. Some content management systems and code editors help you set that, by changing the lang attribute of the html element to the desired language. 
>. Now your browser and assistive technologies know what language the page is in.

###### Avoiding Jargon #############

>. It is generally good practice to avoid acronyms, difficult words, idioms, and unusual phrases. 
>. Many people with or without disability have difficulty understanding such jargon. 


####### Simple Language ##############

>. Another aspect of good authoring is using the simplest and clearest language possible.
>. This includes writing shorter sentences with less complexity. This will mean different things depending on the particular audience and language.
>. In some cases, it may be not possible to simplify the language, for example for legal reasons - when citing a law. 
   Yet alternative versions in simpler language can always be considered, to help make the content more understandable for most audiences.





############# Predictable Content #########################

>. Many people are disoriented or distracted by an inconsistent appearance or behavior of the content. 
>. WCAG Guideline:     Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

>. Important considerations to keep in mind:
       1]] Keep the navigation consistent across your website
       2]] Name buttons and controls consistently too
       3]] Avoid changing the page simply when actionable elements receive focus or input


############## Input Assistance #############################

>. Forms and applications can be confusing or difficult to use for many people. For example, a form without useful instructions makes it hard to complete it.
>. Hence according to WCAG -     Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

>. This can be through good instructions, good labels for buttons and controls in applications - so users can understand the purpose and use.

>. Additionally, feedback is equally important - mostly on errors and how to correct them.
>. Errors need to be described to the user, ideally in simple terms. For example, instead of "wrong date," provide instructions on the required format to help users succeed.
>. In particular for critical transactions such as legal commitments, it is important to provide ways for users to prevent errors.
     These could include:

      >> Submissions can be reversed
      >> Submissions are checked for errors
      >> User is provided opportunity for final review and correction before submitting










############################### Principle 4: Robust #############################

>. Robust content is compatible with different browsers, user agents, and assistive technologies, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and speech recognition software.

>. To maximize this compatibility- we can;
 
     1] Ensuring markup is valid and can be reliably interpreted

     2]] Providing a name, role and value for non-standard user interface components.


>. By meeting this requirement it helps maximize compatibility with current and future agents, including assistive technologies.
>. Additionally, assistive technologies are able to process content reliably, as well as present or to operate it in different ways.



########## Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) ###########

>. WAI-ARIA defines a collection of attributes to help modify incorrect markup and to bridge gaps in HTML to create more accessible experience to those using assistive technology (AT). 
>. WAI-ARIA does not change your web page from a visual perspective, unless you add styling to your CSS that specifically targets WAI-ARIA. 
>. This means that no one except assistive technology devices (and the people using them) will notice any differences between a web page or app with WAI-ARIA and one without it.


############ How to meet WCAG (Quick Reference) #############

>. How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference) is a customizable quick reference to WCAG that includes all of the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques for authors to use as they are developing and evaluating web content. 

>. This tool provides a customizable view of WCAG 2 resources:

            Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 and 2.0
            Techniques for WCAG 2 implementation guidance
            Understanding WCAG 2 supporting information








############# Summary ###############

>. It is important to remember that the underlying spirit of P.O.U.R. isn't about
  rigidly adhering to hard and fast rules - it's about understanding and meeting the
  diverse needs of your users. 

>. Hence following the WCAG guidelines become more of a roadmap rather than a to-do list.

>. Take-away tips: 
       >>  Take it one step at a time - When you're new to digital accessibility it can get very complicated, very fast.
