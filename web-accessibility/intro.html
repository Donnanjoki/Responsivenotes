########################### MODULE 1 ###############################################################

World Wide Web consortium - W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the web.
>. Their mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.


>. Accessibility is about "People".
>. That is in building your application one needs to account for people who cant use a mouse or keyboard
e.g people who are blind - use screen readers

>. The most important thing is making technology work well for people with disabilities. Standards are just one way to help with that.



## Screen Reader Intro ###

To accomplish this:

1. Having well-written page titles - even in code
2. Heading structure - the overall visual structure of the page
3. Good link text
4. Alt- text is also key to getting a good idea of what's on the page when you cannot see it - doesn't have to be detailed
5. When there's a list and how many items are in the list


Who uses Screen-Readers
########################

1] People who are totally blind and listen the the screen reader
2] People who are blind and deaf and use a dynamic braille display
3] People who are blind and can hear the screen reader and also use a dynamic braille display
4] Some people with low vision who can see some of the text
5] Some people with cognitive disabilities who can see just fine but have a difficulty processing written
text and can process spoken language better
6] other..,


Note: some disabilities are hidden from the naked eye- these are inclusive of cognitive and learning disabilities, RSI(repetitive strain injury), and color blindness.

>. Many people with low vision do not use a screen reader -- including people who are losing their vision from progressive eye conditions later life. 
There are many more people with low vision than there are people who are blind.

>. Some people with "tunnel vision" and good visual acuity need small text with little space between lines.

Accessibility deals with all different types of disabilities.

    Example people RSI opt to use speech instead of keyboard, the deaf and sighted - opt to use caption and transcripts
    others will often use multiple adaptive strategies or multiple assistive technologies to get the info on the web


## Reading with and without Wrapping

>. People with low vision often need to increase the text size and spacing - hence wrapping becomes more of an issue.


## Browsing with Increased Spacing ###

>. Increasing text size can make web pages hard to use when they are not designed and coded well. 
Increasing the spacing can, too. It can make text disappear, get cut off, or overlap.



Things to notice:
>> Does any text disappear or get cut off?
>> Does any text, images, and other content overlap?
>> Are all buttons, form fields and other controls visible and usable?
>> Is horizontal and vertical scrolling required to read sentences or blocks of text?


 ?? So why should the web be accessible ??

 >. The WEB is increasingly becoming an important resource hub among different sectors such as;
 government info and services, healthcare, education and training, commerce, news, workplace interaction, recreation, entertainment among others.
 
 >. To provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities.
 Additionally, it is a  basic human rights as per the Access to information and communication technologies defined by the united nations convention
 on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD)


>. With accessible websites, people with disabilities can do ordinary things without feeling left-out, and without even relying on others.
For example::
    >>>. People with quadriplegia who cannot move their arms or legs can shop online to get groceries, gadgets, and gifts delivered
    >>>. People with cognitive and learning disabilities can get adapted versions of information that they can better understand.
    >>>. People who are blind can read the newspaper (through screen readers that read aloud text from the computer), and so can people with cognitive disabilities who have trouble processing written information.
    >>>. People who are deaf can get up-to-the-minute news that was previously available only to those who could hear radio or TV, and so can people who are blind and deaf (through dynamic Braille displays).
    >>>. People who cannot speak can participate in online discussions, such as through blog comments.


# Web accessibility is about removing those barriers so that people with disabilities can use and contribute to the Web.

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

    >>> perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
    >>> contribute to the Web

    >> Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web such as
         auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual

>. Web accessibility overlaps with several areas such as inclusion design for all, universal design and addressing the digital divide;
these broader areas address issues such as geographic location, economic situation, education, language, age, gender, and more — including disability.

>. Accessibility has a more limited focus on people with disabilities though the overlap is beneficial, its paramount we 
maintain a focus on people with disabilities.

>. Accessibility is related to user experience, usability and user-centered design


>>. Accessibility is also about supporting that flexibility for different user needs - hence addressing a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
   >> Note its not uncommon for an individual to have multiple disabilities hence catering to them.


## Web users without disabilities also benefit ##
  1] people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
  2] older people with changing abilities due to aging 
  3] people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm
  4] people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight
  5] people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth


          ### Accessible audio and video media ###
        
>. People who are deaf or hard of hearing need audio information as captions and/or transcripts. (You'll learn about that in later modules, and about other aspects of making media accessible.)

>. Apart from people with disabilities, others also benefit from accessible media.
   Transcripts can be;
     1] Skimmed or read rather than watched or listened to. This is significantly easier and quicker for many users. Sometimes people want to skim the transcript first before deciding whether or not to play the media.
     2] Used offline, printed, or converted to braille.
     3] Used without needing to download video files. For example, to save data on mobile.

    Captions can be used;
      1] In loud environments where users cannot hear the audio. For example, a bar, an airport, or a concert.
      2] In quiet environments where users cannot turn on sound. Example; the library, around sleeping people, public transportation
      3] By people who cannot understand the spoken language well and can understand the written language better. For example, people who are not native speakers of the language.
      4] By people learning to read, including people learning a new language.
      5] To better understand content because users can hear the information in audio and see it in text at the same time. 
      For example, a research study* found that 71% of students without hearing difficulties use captions, primarily to help them focus and retain information.


  ### Web Accessibility Perspectives ###

    A]] Video Captions       - videos isn't about pictures but also sound, hence the need for captions to make videos accessible.

    B]] Color with Contrast  - Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors
                             - Note if it was important to be seen then it needs to be clear enough
                             - Factor in different lighting conditions, additionally people with low contrast sensitivity

    C]] Voice Recognition    - take into account situations where speech is more efficient and makes things easier e.g temporary limitations, dictating emails, placing an order

    D]] Text-to-Voice        - situations where the user is multi-tasking, difficulty reading, individuals with dyslexia, visually impaired.

    E]] Clear layout and design - bad design and poor layout makes finding information difficult and impossible for people with visual impairment,
                                  Additionally, it confuses people with cognitive and learning disability; and impacts those not confident around computers.
                                - This can range from poor UI, lack of clear heading, navigation bars, lack of consistent styling

    F]] Notification & feedback  - Notifications and feedbacks need to be clear; they need to be predictable and understandable.
                                 - avoid using complex or confusing error messages.

    G]] Large Links Buttons and controls - Consider those with situational limitations and reduced dexterity
                                        - responsive or factor in mobile-first design

    H]] Customizable Text       - What is right for you, isn't always right for everyone else.
                                - Hence consider tinkering with font color, spacing and size.

    I]] Understandable Content   - 

    J]] Keyboard Capability    - Whether out of preference or circumstance websites and applications need to be operable via keyboard
                               - This can be due to temporary mobility, permanent disability (requiring mouth-stick to type) or a broken mouse



>. Web Accessibility not only makes websites and apps better but also improves usability, customer centricity, better marketing,
From a business perspective, the reworded link text is stronger marketing and likely leads to much higher click rates and better conversion rates.
longer session duration for the user, access to more people = increased business, better design systems



## Disability is Mismatched Design
###################################

>. Bad design is disabling - when designs and code provide flexibility to meet all user's needs, then they are enabling.
   <The social model of disability.
      >> The model says that people are disabled by barriers in society, not by their impairment or difference.
      >> Barriers can be physical, like buildings not having accessible toilets. Or they can be caused by people's attitudes to difference, like assuming disabled people can't do certain things.
      >> The social model helps us recognize barriers that make life harder for disabled people. Removing these barriers creates equality and offers disabled people more independence, choice and control.

>. Hence disability is caused by a mismatch between the design and the person.



Accessibility is built in fundamentally
#######################################

>> Good design and good code is accessible.

>> 1990, Tims Berners-Lee said "The power of the web is in its universality"
>> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect

>> The web is fundamentally designed to work for all people whatever their hardware, software, language,
location or ability hence making the web accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight and cognitive ability meets the goal.

>. Web accessibility is essential for some, and useful for all. 
Note: Accessibility functionality that is needed by people with disabilities, is also used by people without disabilities.


>> Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.

!!! Accessibility is essential for some, but useful to all !!!



###################################### MODULE TWO ####################################################
        *** People and digital technology and how different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies interact on the web. ***


        ### Scope ###
        1] Recognize the broad diversity of people with disabilities
        2]] List different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies
        3] Recognize the impact of design decisions on accessibility for people
        4]] Explain some of the inter-dependence between components of web accessibility



######### Understanding Technology ##########

>. Assistive Technologies: Refers to the hardware or software that enable people with disabilities to interact and engage with
 the digital environment - such as screen reader or a switch control.


>. Adaptive Strategies: These are techniques that people with disabilities use to interact with the digital environment such as adjusting platform and browser settings or resizing browser windows.
     Example: Audiovisual with closed captions and audio descriptions

>>> NOTE: One type of assistive technology or adaptive strategy is not necessarily neatly mapped to just one type of disability.
          
           Example: Screen reader can also be used people with cognitive or learning technologies not only those who are blind.

>> Due to people being different, many tend to use a variety of technologies and strategies in a variety of creative ways based on their needs.
>> Additionally, some may have multiple disabilities hence the need to combine different assistive technologies and strategies

>> Both assistive and adaptive technologies may be used by everyone regardless of their ability.

    Example: One of the most widely used assistive technologies globally are glasses. In the digital world the most prevalent assistive technology is the keyboard.
            
    Example of other assistive technologies:  glasses with corrective lens, specialized keyboard, spell checker, screen reader, voice assistance

>. Many assistive technologies that may have originated as a tool for people with disabilities have become mainstream and part of day to day.

     Example: keyboard(developed as part of the typewriter by Agostino Fantoni(1802) - to enable his blind sister to write), voice recognition in phones, cars and home devices or pinch zoom on phones
              closed captions(subtitles), and Audio description - While relied on primarily by people who are deaf or hard of hearing, they can also be used by people watching in a second language, in a noisy environment,or by people with no speakers or earphones.
              Some sighted users may also watch programs with audio description switched on so they can cook, drive or multi-task when watching programs




######## Physical Disabilities ##########

>. Many people with physical limitations do not use a mouse hence they rely on other mechanisms such as keyboard, voice control and other
pointing devices to navigate and interact with the web.

>. Hence its important that elements such as buttons, links, and controls are keyboard accessible and not just accessible using a mouse.
>. Hence they are focusable and actionable using a keyboard, have a visible focus state and focus order is logical


   A]] Keyboard Accessibility

>. By default, specific HTML elements (anchors, form controls, image map areas) receive keyboard focus. 
>. However, complex controls not directly available in HTML are often constructed with the use of “generic” HTML elements such as <span> or <div>, coupled with additional JavaScript behavior to make them interactive.
>. These elements do not receive keyboard focus unless they are properly coded, and are therefore impossible for keyboard-only users to reach.


>. Another issue is when the user moves a mouse over a particular element(hover) - if not coded properly the info can be lost to keyboard oly users

>. Examples might be tooltips used for context sensitive help, which means keyboard only.
         >> On touch-screen devices, a tooltip is displayed upon long-pressing—i.e., tapping and holding—an element.[1] Some smartphones have alternative input methods such as a stylus, which can show tooltips when hovering above the screen. 
         >> Microsoft's tooltips feature found in its end-user documentation is named ScreenTips.[4] Apple's tooltips feature found in its developer documentation is named help tags.



   B]] Lack of Visible Focus

 >. A common problem for keyboard only users is visually tracking where they are in a page - unlike mouse users who can
  move the mouse around the page and see the arrow turn into a hand when hovering over actionable elements, to indicate they are actionable. 

>. To accommodate sighted keyboard only users, its important that when the keyboard focus is set to a link - the link changes appearance so the user knows where the focus is.
    >. This is called focus state


   C]] Focus order'

>. When tabbing through content we generally expect content order to follow the visual order of the page reading. For example in English, from left to right and top to bottom.
>. On a typical web page, we expect the order to start with the header, followed by the main navigation, page navigation, main content, and finally the footer. Within those segments of a page, we expect related content to be grouped together.

>. A common issue with focus order, one that screen reader users also experience, is when a button updates or changes the content on the page but focus is not managed. 
    >> For example, a button might be activated to open a modal dialog but the keyboard focus is not moved to the dialog. Instead, a user has to tab through all the page content until they eventually can get focus to the dialog.



   D]] Skip links

>. Lengthy navigation can be a challenge for sighted keyboard users as they must press the Tab key to navigate through the interactive elements that precede the item the user wants to activate. 

>. For example, tabbing through main and page sub navigation before getting to a link they may want to activate in the main body of content.
    >> For a better experience, adding a “Skip to main content link” at the start of a page can be helpful. 
     >> This should then jump the user to the start of the main content so they don't have to tab through all the navigation links..


   C]] Target size and movement

>. Aside from visible focus states, a logical focus order, and keyboard focusable and actionable elements, there are a number of other issues that can negatively or positively affect non mouse users.

>. These challenges are not just limited to keyboard usage but to users with limited dexterity may use a mouse or a finger to navigate desktop and touch screens.
>. People who have shaky hands and find it hard to target links can struggle with fly-out menus for example.
>. Keyboards on touch screens can be difficult to use due to proximity of letters and their small touch target size. Providing alternative ways to input text can help people complete tasks.

>. A solution would be to provide  more usable alternatives such as voice input for search, dropdown menus, radio buttons or checkboxes (rather than free text input),
support for predictive text, and pre-populating form data where possible.



### Switch Controls ###

>. Switch controls offer an alternative way to interact with digital content if using a mouse, keyboard, voice or gestures is not possible.
>. People with limited or no upper body movement such as Repetitive Strain Injury, Cerebral Palsy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson’s disease may use switch controls. 
>. Additionally there are those who highly benefit such as those with cognitive and learning difficulties.


>. There are a wide variety of different types of switches to accommodate various needs:
   
     A]] Sip-and-puff switches which are triggered by sipping and puffing into a straw which then mimics tabbing and clicking.
     B]] Button switches - which can be activated using the hand, foot or head. These can be single switches or multiple switches.
     C]] Camera switches - which can be activated when tilting the head into a camera. Some mobile phones have this built into the accessibility settings.
     D]] Eye Tracking - the process of measuring either the point of gaze (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.


     Example: Assistive Context-Aware Toolkit  used by steve Hawking which was a speech-generating device/ or a voice output communication aid
             
        How did he feed info into the machine??
              >> Due to loss of control of his nerves an infrared switch was mounted on his spectacles, which could detect the slightest twitches or movements in his cheek.
              >> In the past, when his condition was better, he input information by pressing a clicker with his thumb.
     
        The interface??
            
             >> The next part involved forming words using the input from the infrared switch. This interface is a program called EZ Keys, developed by Words Plus Inc. 
                It provided a software keyboard that was displayed on a tablet computer and mounted on one arm of his wheelchair, which was powered by the wheelchair batteries.
            >> The software moved a cursor across the keyboard by either moving through columns or rows. 
               When it reached the desired word, Hawking could stop it with a twitch of his cheek. Individual letters were selected in this way to form words and then sentences.
            >> The software moved a cursor across the keyboard by either moving through columns or rows. 
                When it reached the desired word, Hawking could stop it with a twitch of his cheek. 
                Individual letters were selected in this way to form words and then sentences


        The output??

        >> The final step, probably the easiest, involved speaking the entire sentence out loud. 
        >> To accomplish this, Hawking used a speech synthesizer developed by Speech+ that would speak the sentence once it was approved or completed. 
        >> However, it had a recognizable accent that was described as American, Scottish, or Scandinavian.
        >> The machine allowed him to speak and perform various other tasks, such as checking his email, browsing the internet, making notes, and using Skype to chat with his friends. 



        #### Speech Input ####

>. People with limited dexterity, muscular control limitations such as tremors, poor coordination or paralysis as people living with pain
   those who ,may have arthritis, or people with missing limbs - can use speech recognition software - which enables spoke language to be translated'into text and commands 
   by computer and devices.


>. Instead of typing, people talk into a microphone with the words appearing where your keyboard focus is. 
   As well as the words you speak punctuation such as “comma” or “hyphen”. When browsing Web pages using speech recognition software, it is possible to activate links, fill out forms, and activate buttons. 
   It bypasses the need for a keyboard, mouse, or other pointing device.



   ### Challenges that a speech recognition user might face are similar to that of screen reader and sighted keyboard only users; Screen readers, speech recognition software relies on underlying code to navigate;
       These common issues are;
           A]] Unclear links and buttons - if a button lacks visible text, a user will not know its name and how to activate it. Instead, they will have to number links on a page and select the link by its number. 
           B]] Lack of keyboard access - if a user can not set focus on a button, it can not be activated.
           C]] Illogical focus order - if the focus order is different from the visual order of a page, it can confuse users and they can lose track of where focus is.
           D]] Missing or poor visible focus - when focus states are not clear it might not be possible to know where the current focus is. 



   ## Take-aways from demo vide of speech input:
           >> Code everything properly so labels and numbers methods work

          1]] One thing that slows speech users down is scrolling through small dialog boxes.
           >> It's frustrating to see dropdown menus that only have a few lines in them.
           >> This not only adds unnecessary navigation steps, it's also cognitively more difficult
                        KEY>> Make space for scrolling dialog boxes as large as possible.

          2]] Finding Where the focus is!
             >> Make it obvious where the focus is
             >> One way to address this is keyboard-only and speech input testing.
                                  KEY >> Make sure the system focus is clearly visible.

          3] Finally, single key shortcuts can be a disaster for speech users because\
              >> This is due to the fast that speech-input users speak in phrases.
              >> And if the focus is in the wrong place, you can make a whole lot of things happen with a single phrase.
              >> Developers can make their pages usable for speech input users  by providing a way to turn off single-key shortcuts.
              >> They can turn the disaster into a plus by providing a way for the user to change the shortcuts.
                                        KEY>> And if you use custom keyboard shortcuts, allow users to customize, save, and share those shortcuts.




****************** Basic Keyboard Navigation *********************

>. Basic keyboard navigation relies on Tab key to navigate through links, buttons, form inputs, and other focusable elements.
>. The Enter key selects links and the Enter or Spacebar selects buttons. The arrow keys can then be used to navigate links within menus, options in drop down menus, checkboxes, and so on.


       ##### Blindness #######

>. People with no vision or very little useful vision often use a screen reader. A screen reader is a software that reads out everything on screen. As such, all meaning that is conveyed visually needs to also be conveyed in such a way that it can be read by a screen reader. 

    **** Alternatives ****

>. Images and multimedia that are meaningful or perform an action (such as link or button) must all have a text alternative that accurately and succinctly describes the meaning or purpose

>. People with visual disabilities rely on audio description(AD) and text transcripts.
>. AD is additional commentary that explains what's happening on screen - it describes body language, expressions, movements and on screen changes that are editorially significant.
>. Text transcripts provide an alternatives to all visual and auditory information in text format, which can be used in place of watching video

>. While it is essential to provide alternatives and AD, just as important is the quality of the alternative version.
>. Long and wordy text alternatives for images that are links can slow down navigation. 
>. Describing images that are not editorially significant or functional can make pages cluttered to listen to, and so can overly verbose AD.

 


********** Keyboard Accessibility ************

>. Screen reader users rely fully on the keyboard to navigate. Many of the challenges they experience are the same as the sighted keyboard users we read about earlier in the section on physical disability such as lack of keyboard focus and poor focus order.

*********** Structure ***********

>.. Clear headings, lists, paragraphs, data tables, and form labels are key to understanding the layout and structure of content.
>. While sighted rely on headings to understand what the contents of a page is, as well as to scan the page and jump to the content you are looking for, screen magnification users will look for larger text to understand what the headings are.
>. Screen reader users can do the same by using keyboard shortcuts to list headings in a page to hear a table of contents type overview. They can then select the heading they want to jump to that part of the page.



************ Screen readers *****************

>. A screen reader is a software that reads out everything on screen including text, headings, lists, buttons, text alternatives for images, and form inputs. 
>. When Web content is coded correctly a screen reader announces the name, role and state of an element. 
>. For example, if navigating a form it can read “Select Terms and Conditions, checkbox, not checked”. This breaks down as follows

    Name is “Select Terms and Conditions”
    Role is “checkbox”
    State is “not checked” 


>. Screen readers also have in-built keyboard navigation functionality. 
>. It’s possible to jump between headings, lists, form elements, and links as well as navigate sequentially through elements on a page.
>. Common screen readers include Jaws for Windows, NVDA for Windows, Narrator bundled with Windows, VoiceOver bundled with MacOS and iOS, and TalkBack bundled with Android


>. Users who are blind and read braille may combine a screen reader with a hardware called a refreshable braille display.
>. This sits next to the keyboard and is made up of hundreds of pins that move to create the braille. There are also smaller, portable, Bluetooth braille displays that can connect to mobiles and tablets, and be used on the move. 


>. Screen readers are not just used by blind people, however. Some people with cognitive or learning disabilities find it useful to have the contents of a web page read out.
>. It can help with focus and concentration as well as comprehension of text and images.

NOTE: ScreenCurtain in IOS - Screen curtain switches the screen off so you can test content without seeing it.




*********** LOW VISION **********

>. Low vision users encounter a range of issues to do with design, styling, animation, movement and positioning.


##### Font Size ######

>. It is important that web pages support text resizing within the browser. 
>. Text resizing is different from zoom which resizes the whole page. By going into your browser settings, you can resize text within a page independent of all other content.

##### Poor Contrast #######

>. Poor color contrast can affect a wide range of users including many people with visual, cognition, and learning disabilities. 
>.  It can also impact users on mobile devices in bright environments. Lack of sufficient contrast prevents people from being able to perceive the information that the content is attempting to convey. 
>. This leads to barrier of interaction, as users are unable to identify their location on a page the state of the interactive elements (links and controls), read text, or identify the content of images. 
>. The importance of good color contrast can't be understated as there are many more people with low vision than there are people who are blind.

###### Relying on color ######

>. Color is a key component to web design improving not just aesthetic appeal and branding but also its usability and accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving color.
>. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older users do not see color well. In addition, people using text-only, limited-color or monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented only in color.
>. Another very common barrier that stops people being able to navigate is using color alone to indicate links.
>. Links within plain text can be problematic for users with lower color perception when the only visual indication of a link is a difference of color. 
>. Combining the use of color with an underline or different font weight makes links more recognisable.



##### Animation and moving content ########

>. People with vision, cognition and learning disabilities can find movement and animation distracting. 
>. If content on screen is magnified, animation can take over the whole screen which is disorientating.  
>. Common issues are banner ads containing flashing backgrounds and movement, content contained in a video clip, animated images, or continuously moving carousels.
>. People who are photosensitive can have seizures triggered by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes.
>. Content such as carousels that automatically update their content can be problematic, even when they have Pause or Stop buttons. Often these buttons are deliberately small, lack contrast and are hard to find.

###### Point of regard ########

>. Point of regard is the place where you are reading and have focus.
>. When content is zoomed in, if the place being read changes, people can get lost. 
>. Other challenges arise when content is zoomed in proximity to related content. If related information is not grouped together, it can be lost and become unusable.
>. This could include labels for form inputs and content separated by large areas of blank space. Interactions that change content elsewhere on screen can also be a problem.


**********Screen Magnification ****************

>. This is software that enlarges screen content, which can be used to enlarge all or part of the screen making it easier for people with 
low vision to see text and images.

>. Screen magnification is used by people with some functional vision and can be used in combination with a screen reader. 
>. People with cognitive and learning disabilities may also use screen magnification to help zoom in on content and remove distractions such
as banner adverts and movement.

>. When zoomed in, the focus will follow the mouse pointer which is enlarged and can be customized for size and color to suit reading needs. Other features include:
      >> Smoothing: to make text less blocky and smooth when enlarged and therefore easier to read
      >> Crosshairs: as an alternative to the pointer as some find these easier to follow visually, especially when the size and color can be customized
      >> Color: inversion e.g.  turning text from black-on-white to white-on-black. This can reduce screen glare and is useful for elderly people suffering from age-related macular degeneration


>. Common screen magnification software includes ZoomText on Windows as well as built-in zoom features in Windows, MacOS, and iOS.
>. Responsive websites are beneficial to screen magnification users - because content resizing to a single column reduces scrolling which is tiring.
>. Why are tooltips problematic for screen magnification users - 
Content in tooltips sometimes opens off screen and is lost





*************Takeaways for screen magnification
      ## Ensure on screen changes are obvious to screen magnification users.
      ## Ensure key content is not contained within hover states or tooltips.
      ## Ensure priority content is positioned consistently and where people expect to find it.



######################### Hearing Disabilities #######################################

>. To support people who can't hear, videos should have Closed Captions, subtitles and/or transcripts:
    
    A]] Closed Captions: For the same language as the spoke audio
    B]] Subtitles: for the spoken audio translated into another language
    C]] Transcripts: these are text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content
    D]] Sign Language: uses hand and arm movement, facial expressions and body positions to convey meaning

>. In some regions such as the UK, subtitles are used for both the same language as the audio and for the translation.


####### Closed Captions ############

>. Audio content, such as videos with voices and sounds that do not have captions or transcripts, are completely inaccessible to anyone with significant hearing loss. 
>.  Closed Captions must also be in sync with the audio of the video. This means the text for the Closed Captions appear at the same time as they are spoken. 
>Some video platforms are increasingly providing automatic captioning functionality. 
>. This can be a great help in creating captions but currently not reliable for use by people with disabilities, especially when speakers have accents and for many languages with less support for speech recognition.
>. The existence of captions alone is not always enough to make them usable. 
         >> The closed captions/subtitles need to be easy to read
         >> Have good contrast
         >> Decent size
         >> Set against a background so that they don't get lost in the video background that changes.

####### Media Players #################

>. Media players also have a role to play. Buttons to switch Closed Captions on and off should be easy to find in the player controls. 
>. Ideally, they are grouped together with the Play/Pause, volume, rewind/forward wind and full screen buttons. 
>. Having the button hidden within settings makes it hard to find. 
>. Some older users may start to rely on Closed Captions more and more and may appreciate slightly larger font sizes.


########## Text ########################

For many people who are deaf, sign language is their first language. 
>. As such, written text in closed captions or pages of written text may not be easy to read. 
>. Some people may find it easier to watch a video with sign language alternatives over closed captions. 
>. For pages that contain a lot of text, good use of images, icons and color to reinforce meaning can be really helpful as long as they are not relied on alone. 
>. A good use of layout and structure (headings, lists, etc.) can also make content easier to understand. 




########### Speech Disabilities ######################

>. People may have limited or no speech for a number of reasons:
       1]] Mutism, the inability to speak, may occur due to anxiety, brain injuries, or inability to hear and learn speech
       2]] Speech impediments such as stuttering or Tourettes
       3]] Degenerative disease such as Huntington's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
       4]] Being deaf or hard of hearing may also affect speech
       5]] Temporary illness such as coughs or treatment such as chemo that can affect the throat and speech
       6]] Situational impairments such as being in a noisy environment where a website or app can't easily hear or distinguish voice or a quiet environment where it is not possible to be noisy such as in a library.


>. While we me assume people with speech impediments don't encounter challenges on the web given the web is thought of as a visual medium, a challenging factor includes
 voice-based services such in home devices including Alexa, Google Home, and voice control on mobile such as Siri, Google Voice, and Cortana.

 >. While these are great accessible alternatives for many disabled people, they are not for people with limited or no speech. 

 >. Voice-based services are a good example of an accessible enhancement but one that should not be relied on alone. It is important to include multiple ways to do a task rather than limit it to just one way.

>. Ensuring the alternative to voice-based services is accessible is key. For example, if a contact us page has a phone number and a contact us form the form must be accessible. 
>. If voice search is used on mobile apps, there must be a text based search that is also accessible as well as multiple ways to find information through links.

>. Remember what is convenient for some is essential for others.
>. People with limited or no mobility or dexterity can rely on these applications and devices, but if you are also limited in your speech abilities, you may need help.

      THings to look out for on closed captions and audio descriptions
           >> Are captions in sync?
           >> Do the Closed Captions and Audio Descriptions convey meaning fully and accurately? 
           >> how easy it is to find Audio Described content 
           >> is it possible to customize the size and styles of Closed Captions.

     


########################### COGNITIVE & LEARNING DISABILITIES ########################################

>.Cognition and learning is as broad as it is varied and can affect different people in very different ways. 
>. Given it covers neurological, behavioral, mental health disorders, and aging it can affect how well people see, hear, move, speak, and understand information. 
>. As such, any one of the challenges that affect people with vision, physical, hearing, and speech disabilities could also affect an individual with cognition and learning disabilities.

>. Example; someone who is autistic or with Attention Deficit Disorder may use a screen reader to help them understand web content. 




    >>> Commonly Encountered Challenges <<<<


>. Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts can be difficult to understand and use for many people.
>. When a navigation system is vast and complex, finding the link a user may want becomes problematic, especially with the added dexterity issues that fly out menus can present as described in the section on people with physical limitations.
>. If a site is responsive, it’s not uncommon for some users (including users with low vision) to either resize the window to a smaller mobile size, or zoom content to trigger a responsive layout where navigation is packed away behind a menu button and content is presented in a single column layout making it easier to navigate for some. 
>. Following on from the idea that what works for some won’t work for all, this may not be the preferred strategy for someone who finds scrolling distracting. 
   This is why sites must be flexible so people have a choice.


>> Flexible Design
    >.A key strategy for people with cognition and learning disabilities is to adapt the page to suit their needs using browser controls or custom style sheets.
    >. This allows people to adjust font styles, font and background colors. People can also customize borders, increase line spacing, adjust margins, and so on.
    >. All this is only possible as long as the website has been coded in such a way as to allow people to make such customization.

>> Text
    >. Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand can prevent users from understanding content and context.
    >.Use of metaphors and slang can be difficult for some people who do not understand nuance. 
    >. Walls of text can also be equally difficult to understand. Ideally, long passages of text should make good use of headings, subheadings, bulleted and numbered lists as well as images, graphs or other illustrations to help explain and reinforce information contained within the text.

>> Images
     >. Images can be both helpful or distracting depending on how they are used.
     >. By using a balanced way, images can enhance the understanding of a page by providing a secondary way of conveying information already contained in the text and reinforcing meaning.

>> Movement & Animation
   >. Movement and animation should be avoided, or come to a rest after a short time. 
   >. Alternatively, a stop, pause or mute button can be provided to stop the animation or media.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Browser Settings and Customization <<<<<<<<<<<<

>. A common adaptive strategy among users with low vision, no vision, cognitive and learning disabilities is
to resize browser windows. 

>. Additionally, changes in layout can help in a number of ways;

     >> For example,  a mobile layout on a desktop might benefit users who wish to see less clutter on the page, remove distracting banner ads and minimize the number of key tabs to get to content. 
                       For others, line lengths of text in articles and blog posts might be too long to read. 
                       Reducing screen width therefore helps reduce line length. 


>. There are also a number of accessibility extensions that can be added to browsers. 
>. Extensions can provide a number of features to help navigation such as color filters, visible focus indicators, Caret browsing and spatial navigation.
>. Some users may use customization tools to adapt content to their needs. These can do similar things to browser settings but might give people more choice. Tools can change font sizes, background colors, line spacing and so on. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Customizing content: 
         ZOOM "Control +""
         Resize the window - Resize the browser window by dragging the bottom right corner to the left to make a single column layou








################## Essential Components of Accessibility #####################

>.  It takes more than assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to make web content accessible.
>. Other key ingredients include;
       1]] Technology: assistive technology, web authoring, and evaluation tools.
       2]] Standards and Guidelines:
            A]] Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
            B]] Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)
            C]] User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)
      3]] People - not only those with disabilities using digital products but also everyone involved in creating products and services.





      ####### Technology #######

>. Apart from assistive technologies, web authoring and evaluation tools are also essential in making content accessible to people with disabilities.

>. Authoring tools enable us to create and publish digital content such as e.g CMS  (wordpress, drupal),
code editors(Atom, sublime), social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)

>. Software providers who create such tools have the responsibility of making these tools accessible and also provide support for the generation of
accessible content. Same applies to content creators who have the responsibility of generating accessible content.

>. Evaluation tools are used by web developers, designers and quality assurance testers to test websites and applications for accessibility.
hence ensuring the programs or online services on the web meet the accessibility guidelines.

>. No automated evaluation tool can tell you if your site is 100% accessible, though they can only test some of the accessibility requirements that do not need human intervention.
   Example: An evaluation tool can identify if an image has a missing text alternative but can not tell you if that text alternative is appropriate in the context where it is present. 
   Testing done by a human is essential to ensure an accessible user experience.

    >> Can accessibility evaluation tools test the accessibility of images? - 
               >>>>>>>>>>. No, an evaluation tool can only identify if an image has a missing text alternative but can not tell you if that text alternative is appropriate in the context where it is present.



   ####### Standards and technical Specifications ####### 

>. To be able to author and evaluate accessible content, we need to follow guidelines. There are three sets of accessibility guidelines
set up by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).

  1]] Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)- defines requirements on how to make Web content such as text, images, multimedia, structure and presentation accessible
  2]] Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) defines requirements on how to make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content. 
  3]] User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) provides guidance on how to make user agents accessible to people with disabilities. User agents include browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers and other applications that render web content

>. In addition to guidelines we have technology specifications that ensure content accessible, when followed correctly leads to production of output accessible content.





##### People #####


>. The key to bringing technology and guidelines together to create accessible user experiences are people.

>. Hence everyone in the software development life cycle is involved;
   >> Product Owners, and organizations - have the responsibility to mandate and resource teams to create accessible products
   >> Developers - responsible fot authoring content that follows technology specifications and accessibility guidelines
   >> User experience professionals and designers - are responsible for creating accessible layouts, images, presentation, features and user journeys as well as carrying our user research and usability testing with people with disabilities
   >> Content Editors - Responsible for content strategy, text, equivalent alternatives for no-text content and other general text elements presented in the pages.
   >> Quality assurance and testers - responsible for checking for compliance with standards and guidelines using a combination of evaluation tools, assistive technologies and manual testing




>. Technology, standards and guidelines, and people all have a part to play in making content accessible and usable for people with disabilities. 
   If one area is weak, however, the accessibility of a product can be compromised.


   Example: A social media website allows you to upload images but there is no facility to create a text alternative for the image. The platform is a content management system which should follow ATAG and WCAG but does not.
          
   Example: For example, an organization might use a content management system (CMS) that does not support the output of accessible content. No matter how good the content authors are, they will not be able to make their content fully accessible. Or it will take them a lot of time and effort they could be spending elsewhere.

>. To avoid such scenarios, an organization should have in place an accessibility policy and strategy that support the procurement of accessible authoring and evaluation tools, training and so on.


                    ********* Activity *********
## Contact a person with a disability and interview them about what accessibility features and barriers they encounter when trying to access digital content or applications.
               >> Not being aware that these assistive and adaptive technologies are available
               >> learning curve difficulty
               >> Too embarrassed to ask for help
               >> Inconsistency in some sites
               >> sensory overload, lack of audio description, bad UI, small texts and buttons on websites, outdated sites
