Introduction to Web Accessibility by W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

Scope: 
1. Definition of Web Accessibility
2. People and digital technology and how different types of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies 
interact on the web.
3. Business case and benefits - organizational business case for web accessibility
4. Principles, standards and checks - international standards from W3C web accessibility initiative (WAI)
5. Integrating accessibility into your design and development processes and tips.



World Wide Web consortium - W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the web.
>. Their mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.


>. Accessibility is about "People".
>. That is in building your application one needs to account for people who cant use a mouse or keyboard
e.g people who are blind - use screen readers

>. The most important thing is making technology work well for people with disabilities. Standards are just one way to help with that.



## Screen Reader Intro ###

To accomplish this:

1. Having well-written page titles - even in code
2. Heading structure - the overall visual structure of the page
3. Good link text
4. Alt- text is also key to getting a good idea of what's on the page when you cannot see it - doesn't have to be detailed
5. When there's a list and how many items are in the list


Who uses Screen-Readers
########################

1] People who are totally blind and listen the the screen reader
2] People who are blind and deaf and use a dynamic braille display
3] People who are blind and can hear the screen reader and also use a dynamic braille display
4] Some people with low vision who can see some of the text
5] Some people with cognitive disabilities who can see just fine but have a difficulty processing written
text and can process spoken language better
6] other..,


Note: some disabilities are hidden from the naked eye- these are inclusive of cognitive and learning disabilities, RSI(repetitive strain injury), and color blindness.

Accessibility deals with all different types of disabilities.

    Example people RSI opt to use speech instead of keyboard, the deaf and sighted - opt to use caption and transcripts
    others will often use multiple adaptive strategies or multiple assistive technologies to get the info on the web


## Reading with and without Wrapping

>. People with low vision often need to increase the text size and spacing - hence wrapping becomes more of an issue.


## Browsing with Increased Spacing ###

>. Increasing text size can make web pages hard to use when they are not designed and coded well. 
Increasing the spacing can, too. It can make text disappear, get cut off, or overlap.



Things to notice:
>> Does any text disappear or get cut off?
>> Does any text, images, and other content overlap?
>> Are all buttons, form fields and other controls visible and usable?
>> Is horizontal and vertical scrolling required to read sentences or blocks of text?


 ?? So why should the web be accessible ??

 >. The WEB is increasingly becoming an important resource hub among different sectors such as;
 government info and services, healthcare, education and training, commerce, news, workplace interaction, recreation, entertainment among others.
 To provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities.
 Additionally, it is a  basic human rights as per the Access to information and communication technologies defined by the united nations convention
 on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD)


>. With accessible websites, people with disabilities can do ordinary things without feeling left-out, and without even relying on others.
For example::
    >>>. People with quadriplegia who cannot move their arms or legs can shop online to get groceries, gadgets, and gifts delivered
    >>>. People with cognitive and learning disabilities can get adapted versions of information that they can better understand.
    >>>. People who are blind can read the newspaper (through screen readers that read aloud text from the computer), and so can people with cognitive disabilities who have trouble processing written information.
    >>>. People who are deaf can get up-to-the-minute news that was previously available only to those who could hear radio or TV, and so can people who are blind and deaf (through dynamic Braille displays).
    >>>. People who cannot speak can participate in online discussions, such as through blog comments.


# Web accessibility is about removing those barriers so that people with disabilities can use and contribute to the Web.

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

    >>> perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
    >>> contribute to the Web

    >> Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the web such as
         auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual

>. Web accessibility overlaps with several areas such as inclusion design for all, universal design and addressing the digital divide;
these broader areas address issues such as geographic location, economic situation, education, language, age, gender, and more — including disability.

>. Accessibility has a more limited focus on people with disabilities though the overlap is beneficial, its paramount we 
maintain a focus on people with disabilities.

>. Accessibility is related to user experience, usability and user-centered design


>>. Accessibility is also about supporting that flexibility for different user needs - hence addressing a wide range of abilities and disabilities.
   >> Note its not uncommon for an individual to have multiple disabilities hence catering to them.


## Web users without disabilities also benefit ##
  1] people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
  2] older people with changing abilities due to aging 
  3] people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm
  4] people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight
  5] people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth


          ### Accessible audio and video media ###
        
>. People who are deaf or hard of hearing need audio information as captions and/or transcripts. (You'll learn about that in later modules, and about other aspects of making media accessible.)

>. Apart from people with disabilities, others also benefit from accessible media.
   Transcripts can be;
     1] Skimmed or read rather than watched or listened to. This is significantly easier and quicker for many users. Sometimes people want to skim the transcript first before deciding whether or not to play the media.
     2] Used offline, printed, or converted to braille.
     3] Used without needing to download video files. For example, to save data on mobile.

    Captions can be used;
      1] In loud environments where users cannot hear the audio. For example, a bar, an airport, or a concert.
      2] In quiet environments where users cannot turn on sound. Example; the library, around sleeping people, public transportation
      3] By people who cannot understand the spoken language well and can understand the written language better. For example, people who are not native speakers of the language.
      4] By people learning to read, including people learning a new language.
      5] To better understand content because users can hear the information in audio and see it in text at the same time. 
      For example, a research study* found that 71% of students without hearing difficulties use captions, primarily to help them focus and retain information.


  ### Web Accessibility Perspectives ###

    A]] Video Captions
    B]] Color with Contrast
    C]] Voice Recognition
    D]] Text-to-Voice
    E]] Clear layout and design
    F]] Notification & feedback
    G]] Large Links Buttons and controls
    H]] Customizable Text
    I]] Understandable Content
    J]] Keyboard Capability




>. Web Accessibility not only makes websites and apps better but also improves usability, customer centricity, better marketing,
From a business perspective, the reworded link text is stronger marketing and likely leads to much higher click rates and better conversion rates.
longer session duration for the user, access to more people = increased business, better design systems



## Disability is Mismatched Design
###################################

>. Bad design is disabling - when designs and code provide flexibility to meet all user's needs, then they are enabling.
   <The social model of disability.
      >> The model says that people are disabled by barriers in society, not by their impairment or difference.
      >> Barriers can be physical, like buildings not having accessible toilets. Or they can be caused by people's attitudes to difference, like assuming disabled people can't do certain things.
      >> The social model helps us recognize barriers that make life harder for disabled people. Removing these barriers creates equality and offers disabled people more independence, choice and control.

>. Hence disability is caused by a mismatch between the design and the person.



Accessibility is built in fundamentally
#######################################

>> Good design and good code is accessible.

>> 1990, Tims Berners-Lee said "The power of the web is in its universality"
>> Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect

>> The web is fundamentally designed to work for all people whatever their hardware, software, language,
location or ability hence making the web accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight and cognitive ability meets the goal.

>> Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services.


!!! Accessibility is essential for some, but useful to all !!!
