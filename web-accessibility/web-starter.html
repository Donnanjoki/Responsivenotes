################### Planning and Managing Web Accessibility ######################################

1.  Introduction to discover and plan


>. The first steps to achieving accessibility goals in the discover and plan stage is to;
    1]] understand the current state of accessibility
    2]] build enthusiasm for it in your organization
    3]] create a plan and develop clear goals
    4]] start to build an environment that supports accessibility


>. These can further be stabilized through activities such as;
    
****************  A]] Explore your current environment <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>. Investigate your organization's current state of accessibility and your legal obligations to help understand the work ahead.
>. Before works and discussion with stakeholders can begin on accessibility several things need to be accessed.
>. These include; 

   A] Governance
 
    What accessibility laws, policies or industry standards apply to your organization?
    Is there an executive sponsor for accessibility in your organization? 

   B] Policy

   How well do the existing policies and processes support accessible practices; 
   for example, are there procurement policies to ensure purchasing of accessible tools and content, can accessibility be improved in design and development processes?

   C] Awareness and Capability

   What is the general awareness about accessibility in different parts of your organisation?
   What is the level of accessibility knowledge and expertise of the staff creating and maintaining your digital content? 
   What support is available to improve the situation, such as training or access to accessibility mentors? 

   D] Assets and tools
 

    What digital content do you have, such as websites, intranets, mobile apps, and digital communication channels? What is their current level of accessibility?
    Do staff have access to appropriate tools to assist in testing accessibility?


   E] Finance

  What, if any, budget is being spent on accessibility?


>. Note; finding all this information may feel like a big task, the more information you can collect about the state of accessibility in your organisation and its current commitment to accessibility, the better placed you will be to move forward with planning and implementing accessibility.


   #### Review digital content and products ###

>. Create a baseline for future work
>. Identify where training or additional expertise is needed.
>. Help clarify how big a problem exists
>. Show progress to stakeholders as you highlight existing problems and start to fix issues

>. This review may highlight instances of good practice, which identifies staff or suppliers who have accessibility skills to build on. 
>. It may also identify problems to be avoided in the future, even if your objectives involve completely replacing an existing website.

>. Accessibility checks can be performed at all stages of the process, not only when the website is completed.

When you want to do a comprehensive evaluation:

    Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) — Provides a structured approach to help evaluate websites for accessibility.
    https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/


#### Reviewing Authoring Tools ###

>. In addition to reviewing your digital products and content, it is important to also understand how well authoring tools support you in creating and maintaining accessible content.

>. One of the first things that an organization should do when exploring their environment is create a list of their digital assets.
>. Accessibility requirements for tools used to create digital products and content are covered
   in the W3C's authoring tool accessibility guidelines, known as ATAG, for short.

########## Activity: Creating a digital Product List ##############

Create a digital product list

    1. Make a list of all the digital products your organization has that may need to be assessed for accessibility.
    2. If you have a large number of digital products, prioritize your digital products. Priority should be given to:
       a]  Products or content within products that provide critical content to your users, for example, the ability to access your bank account and do transactions online, the ability to look up your payslip in an online human resources system, information about emergency evacuation
       b]  Products or content within products that have a large number of users, although if the content is critical for users then that takes priority over the number of users
       c]  Product life-cycle - if a product due to be replaced or redeveloped in the near future, then you could fix only critical issues and provide support to users who still encounter barriers while the new and accessible product is build 









####################  B]] Set objectives and allocate resources ########################################
    



     i) Set objectives 

>. Create objectives that align with your accessibility goals and ensure you have the necessary resources to meet them
>. Clear objectives include what the outcomes you want to achieve and by when.
   
>. Once you've explored your environment to identify accessibility gaps, you can create measurable objectives that address these gaps within the organization’s digital content, processes, and policies. 
>. Objectives help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that successful delivery can be determined.

>. When setting objectives, include
    A] deliverables - what are the outcomes you want to achieve
    B] timelines - when are you going to achieve these deliverables
    C] success measures - how do you know when you've met your objective

>. Ensure that objectives have agreement and support from management. This will help secure the necessary resources, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. 
>. Objects should additionally help integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks, production workflows, or quality assurance processes.

>. Examples of objectives might include:

   >>  Develop an accessibility policy by year-end
   >> Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and enforce for all new digital procurement activities by year-end
   >> Review your primary website or mobile app and address any Level A and AA accessibility issues within 18 months
   >> Prepare and deliver an accessible content course for all content authors by May
   >> Update the design approval process to include accessibility considerations before June






ii) Secure budget and resources

>. Your budget and resource needs will depend on your accessibility goals and the extent of the work required to achieve them. For each activity, consider what resources are needed and ensure they are available.
>. Some things to consider include:

    i) Accessibility evaluations – how often they need to occur and how extensive they need to be
    ii) Evaluation with people – how will you involve users with disabilities in evaluations
    iii) Reviews of policies and procedures – how long will it take to determine which policies need to change, make the changes and implement the changes.
    iv) Recruitment – do you need to recruit accessibility specialists or coordinators to help you meet your accessibility goals
    v) Staff training – deliver general awareness-raising as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as design, development or content writing.
    vi) Tooling – adaptation or possible replacement of content authoring tools, such as the content management system (CMS), or acquiring accessibility evaluation tools
   vii) Experienced support – external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improve

>. Once the budget is determined, ensure that you have sufficient approval. Use your business case to help secure budget.

>. Ensure that the final budget includes how it will support you to meet your objectives and targets, and what return on investment could be expected. 
>. This might include better website performance, reduction in maintenance costs, higher sales, improved visitor statistics, or improved corporate social responsibility.




########################3 C]] Gather support and raise awareness #########################################

>. Engage and gather support from stakeholders and raise awareness about your accessibility program



############## Raise awareness about accessibility ############


  #### Gathering Support for accessibility

>. To achieve your accessibility goals, support needs to come from across the organization. 
>. Support can come from different areas, from design and development teams right through to senior management.
>. Regular communication with management and other stakeholders helps you maintain long-term support for your accessibility goals.


>. Key stakeholder and management support will simplify the process of introducing or improving accessibility. 
>. Management support will help with prioritization clashes, access to resources, and communication activities. 
>. Use your business case to help secure support from these groups.
>. Senior management support will help with prioritization clashes, access to resources, and communication activities. 
>. They help the process of introducing or improving accessibility, with accessibility subject matter experts conducting training and other activities.


>. Support for accessibility is often found among project teams involved in the creation of digital content. 
>. Encourage interest in these groups by exploring how accessibility has broad benefits. 
>. This will help increase the enthusiasm for accessibility and create more advocates or champions.


>. Support doesn't only come from internal stakeholders. It is also important to engage external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. For example:

    A] Negotiate and set expectations with suppliers to better support you with accessibility
    B] Develop meaningful relationships with your customers and users to understand what is important to them
    C] Provide feedback channels to engage with advocacy groups



>. Communicate your efforts publicly to help set expectations and increase internal commitment for accessibility. 




      ###### Raise awareness about accessibility

>. A lack of awareness is a common reason for organizations not adopting accessible practices.
>. Many people may know little or nothing about accessibility. Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on digital accessibility. Others may not be aware of the value that accessibility brings. 
>. A general introduction to accessibility, including your organizational goals, will improve awareness. It will also build enthusiasm for the task.


>. Building awareness about accessibility and disability needs to be a going activity, not a one-off. 
>. An ongoing program keeps accessibility front-of-mind for everyone and makes sure the importance and awareness of accessibility are also reinforced for new staff.



   >>>>>>>>>>> ideas for raising awareness about accessibility and disability in your organization include <<<<<<<<<,

    A] Invite people with disability to share their lived experience of disability, how they use technology and how it impacts their lives; make sure people are compensated for their time
    B] Invite accessibility leaders and champions from other organizations to talk about how they have raised awareness and capability in their organization
    C] Ask accessibility vendors to come in and share their experience on digital accessibility – make sure to be clear this is not an opportunity for a sales pitch!
    D] Deliver introduction to accessibility sessions tailored to the accessibility interests of your audience, such as managers, researchers, designers, developers, testers, and content authors
    E] Use good quality videos such as the Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards and Web Accessibility Perspectives videos to introduce accessibility and start a group conversation about your accessibility initiatives

>. You can also encourage your organization to celebrate international days related to disability and inclusion, 
   such as International Day of People with Disability (3 December) and Global Accessibility Awareness Day (third Thursday in May).






############################  D]] Create your accessibility policy ####################################

>. Create an accessibility policy for creating, managing and delivering accessible digital content

>. An accessibility policy captures your goals and targets for accessibility in your organization.

>. An accessibility policy captures your goals and targets. Policies vary across organizations but at a minimum establishes what accessibility standard you aim to conform to and by when.

>. or example, your policy might only state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.1 Level AA within one year. 
>. A policy may cover other topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting.

>. Your accessibility policy may be standalone or integrated into other policies within your organization.
>. Your accessibility policy could be part of a non-discrimination or equal opportunity policy.

>. Related documents should also mention accessibility, such as brand guidelines, coding standards, and project management frameworks.
>. This helps everyone to see accessibility as a core feature, rather than an afterthought.

>. Ensure the policy has approval and backing from management. This will help you implement your policy, ensuring that resources are available and activities are prioritized.



### Reference Standards ###

>. Reference specific standards in policy documents to ensure clear criteria for accessibility. 
>. These standards include Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) and User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG).


### Define your conformance level ###

>. It is critical for the success of your policy to select a conformance level you can realistically achieve: level A, AA or AAA. 

>. Once selected, specify what level of conformance is to be achieved for each referenced standard.


### Define the scope of your policy ###

>. Clearly state the scope of your policy, and how it applies to different parts of the digital content in scope.

>. Your policy may apply to:

    1] digital assets used by people in your organization, such as intranets 
    2] digital assets used by people outside your organization, such as websites
    3] websites and web content that can be viewed on desktop and/or mobile
    4]  authoring tools that can be used to create, access or modify content
    5] documents, such as electronic newsletters, Word documents, PDFs
    6] third-party services, such as credit card payment services or online mapping services
    7] third-party platforms, such as video streaming or social media channels
    8] non-web digital software, such as mobile apps
    9] legacy systems



>. If you are using third-party services or platforms, it is your responsibility to ensure they are accessible or for providing accessible alternatives. 
>. This is true even if you don't have full control over such content and services.


### Set your milestones ###

>. For all items in scope of your policy, define clear and measurable milestones, including dates, by which each will be met. 
>. If your policy goals and milestones have already been met, then say when the content was last reviewed. 
>. Deadlines should be realistic but issues should not be left too long.

>. In some cases, a phased approach might be appropriate. You could take an approach that addresses barriers that have the most impact on your users, such as:

   1]  Fix significant accessibility barriers
   2]  Fix accessibility barriers that occur in content or features that your user’s need most
   3]  Fix issues that occur in templates or components used across the product
   4]  Fix other accessibility barriers 



>. You could do this as part of a planned maintenance update. Clearly outline any details of this type of approach in your policy.

### Define your monitoring and review process ###

>. Regularly review progress towards policy goals. Update the policy when there are changes to the timescale or when you meet milestones. 
>. To maintain the target level of accessibility, specify a process and schedule to review content and tools in scope.

>. Feedback from users who might find accessibility barriers can help you identify issues. 
>. Your policy should include information on how you will gather feedback. 
>. It should also include information on how your organization will handle and respond to feedback.

############################ E]] Create your accessibility statements  ########################################

>. Create accessibility statements for websites, mobile applications or other digital content.


    ?? Why provide an accessibility statement ??

>. Accessibility statements are important for several reasons, including:

    1] showing your users that you care about accessibility and about them
    2] providing your users with information about the accessibility of your content
    3] demonstrating a commitment to accessibility, and to social responsibility
    4] In some situations it may be required in public bodies that implement the EU Web Accessibility Directive


>. What to include in accessibility statement???


   1]  A commitment to accessibility for people with disabilities
   2] The accessibility standard applied, such as WCAG 2.1
   3] Contact information in case users encounter problems

>. It is also advisable to include the following information:

    4] Any known limitations, to avoid frustrating of your users
   5]  Measures taken by your organization to ensure accessibility
   6]  Technical prerequisites, such as supported web browsers
   7]  Environments in which the content has been tested to work
   8]  References to applicable national or local laws and policies



   ### How to write an accessibility statement? ###


>. Accessibility statements are primarily for users of your content. Usually, they will refer to accessibility statements when they encounter problems. 
>. Technical or legal language will likely lead to confusion and increase frustration rather than help your users.
>. It is important to write in simple language rather than use the language of developers and lawyers. 
>. Make sure that the information is useful and relevant to your users.
>. In particular, accessibility statements should explain functionality and known limitations in common terms.

>. For example, rather than to say “WCAG Success Criterion 1.2.2 was not met”, it is better to say “videos do not have captions”.
>. Accessibility statements are not technical assessments or declarations of conformity. They should, however, refer to such background to provide verification and increase credibility.


  
  ### Where to put an accessibility statement? ###

>. Accessibility statements should be easy to find. 
>. Linking them from several places, such as from the footer, help menu, sitemap, about page, and other prominent areas help users to find them. 
  
>. Use consistent link names for your accessibility statements to help users recognize them.
  
  
   ### Accessibility statement generator tool ## 
     https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create

>. This tool helps you create an accessibility statement for your own website, mobile app and other digital content.

>. It can also be used in different contexts and jurisdictions.


   Resources: Minimal Accessibility Statement- https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/minimal-example/
              Complete Accessibility Statement- https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/complete-example/


############################# F]] Create a monitoring framework ########################################

>. Create a standard way of monitoring and reporting on progress against your accessibility goals.

>. To track progress, create a standard way of monitoring and reporting findings to stakeholders across your organization. 

>. Milestones can help you measure your progress. Ensure that each milestone has specific and measurable criteria to indicate what progress has occurred.


>. Some example criteria include:

   A]  number of WCAG Success Criteria passed, and their level
   B]  number of complaints received related to accessibility
   C]  calls handled from people who were unable to process their application online
   D]  positive social media comments on the accessibility of service
   E]  training sessions on accessibility delivered to the staff


>. Ensure that accessibility progress is part of standard reporting for all parts of your organization that have accessibility responsibility.

>.It is useful to develop a standard report structure to capture the measure of accessibility for websites or tools. 
>. This allows for comparisons between different websites, as well as between different versions of the same website.

>. For long-term or ongoing goals, you need to plan regular monitoring to ensure that achieved goals do not slip. When goals aren't being met and issues are identified, ask why these issues are occurring. 

Some questions to consider include:

    >> Are issues caused by staff members who have not had adequate training?
    >> Are they as a result of a change in the content management system (CMS)?
    >>  Are the requirements of the publishing process unclear?


>. Plan for regular reviews to monitor progress over time. Assign responsibility for the checks and ensure there are clear escalation paths for issues











************************************* Accessibility Activity ****************************************

         1] create an accessibility statement for a product of your choice, or
         2] review an existing accessibility statement if you have one
             // examples the White house accessibility statement


Option 1: Create an  accessibility statement

    Choose a website or mobile app that you want to create an accessibility statement for

PART 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> IMPLEMENT & maintain

<!--


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Aspects of concern <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,,

A]] Accessibility is a shared responsibility - we'll look at what aspects of accessibility different roles should assume
B]] Skills need to be built - and maintained as the environment and staff change
C]] Products need to be created with accessibility -and future enhancements need to also meet your organization's commitments 
D]] Changes need to be monitored - platform changes, technology changes, standards and legal requirement changes, and policy and skills kept up to date
E]]  Stakeholder Engagement - for both internal and external shareholders




>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>. Accessibility and Roles <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,

>. In a sustainable multi-disciplinary team, its the overall team responsibility to design, build, operate and iterate digital services, with them being led by a product manager with decision-making responsibility. 

>. Other roles could look like;
     
   A]] product manager (product owner) - overall responsibility
   B]] user researcher - ensuring people with disability are included
   C]] interaction designer - considers the different ways people access the web
   D]] graphic designer - color and contrast choices
   E]] content author/designer - content structure and readability
   F]] developer - semantic coding
   G]] QA/tester - checks all good before release

>. Alternatively, Some organizations engage the services of an accessibility expert part-time, in addition to up-skilling themselves around digital accessibility, to help meet their commitment.

           https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Role_definition_document



>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Build and Maintain skills <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Resource: https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/


>. Training is an initial investment that pays off as understanding of accessibility increases and it becomes more common practice.
>. Increased knowledge should result in more accessible implementations first time, helping to reduce evaluation and rework costs and limit risk.

>. Examples of training include;

    
    A]] Introductions to accessibility for everyone
    B]] How accessibility benefits your business for management and project managers
    C]] Accessible design for graphic and UX designers 
    D]] Writing accessible content for non-technical content authors
    E]] Accessible coding solutions for developers
    F]] Testing for accessibility for QA and testers



>. Accessibility training is not a once-off 'tick and forget' activity. The knowledge and skills of your digital teams need to be monitored on a regular basis to be sure people are up-to-date.
>.  It is essential that new staff are supported to gain the skills and  expertise needed to meet your ongoing accessibility goals.

Resource: https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessibility-training/





>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Create accessibility, evaluate and prioritize <<<<<<<<<<<<<

>. Create your content accessible from the start of the project to reduce any rework and repairs later on. 
>. Sometimes we refer to the concept of 'born accessible' or 'accessible by default' to ensure accessibility is considered from the earliest stages, even if you're procuring services to help with the project.

>. If it's an existing project that wasn't 'born accessible' and you have fixes to make, then you should prioritize these depending on the impact they will have on your users.



>. The earlier you evaluate a project for accessibility, the more accessible it will be at the end as you'll have caught and addressed issues early and not repeated them. 


       A] Evaluate Early

>. 
    A] undertake research with your users before deciding on the solution
    B] check designs and mockups before you start coding
    C] check your content as it's being written for plain language and understanding, including micro-content for forms and errors, and for alternative text for images
    D] check the code as each component is being built - learn and adapt rather than waiting until the end
    E] undertake usability testing with people with disabilities on a regular basis as well as technical WCAG testing




         B] Prioritize accessibility issues to address



    A] Start with issues that are easier to fix, to help build motivation in the team and demonstrate success.
    B] Prioritize the development of accessible templates and components to support the creation of accessible content.
   C]  Prioritize visual design to synchronize with an on-going re-branding activity within the organization.
   D]  Prioritize recruitment or procurement policies to support anticipated hiring and acquisitions.
   E]  De-prioritize issues that are related to tools or systems, such as a content management system (CMS), that are expected to be changed soon anyway.




>. Involve different perspectives, including internal and external stakeholders, in the prioritization process. Review the situation regularly to benefit from arising opportunities.

>. You can also prioritize based on

   >> the impact an accessibility issue is likely to have on users
   >>  the importance or frequency of access of any page or section.




            C] Assign tasks to roles and fix priorities

>. Communicate deliverables and assignments to assigned team members. Ensure staff know what is expected of them, that they have the necessary capabilities, and are clear on schedules.
>. Ensure that everyone has the resources to help them with their tasks. Provide a clear process for people to flag issues and ensure that any issues raised are managed and responded to efficiently.
>. 





>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Involve Users <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,,,

>. Web accessibility is not just about meeting a technical standard, it's about ensuring that our websites, mobile apps, and digital documents can be used by the widest possible audience, including people with disabilities.

>. In addition to finding accessibility problems, evaluating with users with disabilities usually reveals general usability problems that impact all users, including those without disabilities.

Resources: https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/involving-users/



// Where to find people with disaBILITY

>. A consideration with recruitment is to cover a range of disabilities. People with different disabilities, using different technologies, will have different needs and provide different insights. Some places you can contact to find people with disability for user research and usability testing include:

    >>>>>>>>>>>> local and national disability organizations
    >>>>>>>>>>>> universities and higher education institutions - students like casual work
    >>>>>>>>>>>>  ageing organizations - older people often have impairments and disabilities as a result of age

>. Finally, be sure to pay them for their time; many accessibility testing organizations also pay transport costs.

// When to involve users

>. It is best to include users as early as possible in a project, but including them at some point is better than not including them at all. 
>. People with disability should be involved in the initial user research before a project begins and at the following review points where possible:

    >>>>>> user interface designs
    >>>>>> graphic designs
    >>>>>> content design
    >>>>>> component design
    >>>>>> coded website



// Analyzing user results

>. Caution: Carefully consider all input. Avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities.

>. A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with the web nor how people with other disabilities might interact. 
>. Getting input from a range of users is best.







>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Monitoring Changes <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<,

>.Policies and standards that your organization is conforming with can be updated – you need to keep abreast of these
>. Government policies and ISO or local standards are also updated regularly. This is often to reflect updates in WCAG, meaning the policies and related standards usually lag behind WCAG releases. 


// Monitor skills requirements

>. Ensuring new staff have the skills to deliver on your organizations accessibility commitments has to be a priority in on-boarding. 
>. Staff may also be changing roles or adopting new roles, especially in small organizations, so making sure they understand the accessibility responsibilities in the new or additional role is critical.


// Monitor new technology

>. Thinking about new technologies and the access and accessibility limitations they might present, 
   and approaches to being inclusive before adopting them, can save a lot of retro-fitting expenses later on.

>. In parallel, we have to consider the way users are used to interacting with websites and apps - is the latest technique  being easily understood by the users.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.   Continue Engagement <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


>. It is important to continue to engage with both internal and external stakeholders to maintain momentum.

    >> Internal stakeholders will want to know that progress continues to be made and that the organizations' commitments are being met.
    >> External stakeholders will also need to be reminded of your commitment and assured that you are continuing to meet their expectations around accessibility.


// Internal Stakeholder 

>. Long-term engagement should also consider how accessibility changes are impacting project delivery:

    A] Are projects costing less?
    B] Is less time needed to ensure that accessibility is covered?
    C] Are there less problems at the end of projects?
    D] Are the users providing more positive feedback, or less complaints, about accessibility?

Ensure that any on-going customer support is able to respond to users' accessibility issues. This will include training for first line support and clear processes for recording and addressing issues.


// External Stakeholders 

>. Continue to work with any of your external suppliers who are still to meet your accessibility requirements. Be sure to keep them informed of any changes to your expectations such as a change in your accessibility policy to a new version of WCAG. 
>. If existing external suppliers are continuing to provide support, ensure they continue to meet your accessibility expectations.


>. Keeping external people who provide accessibility feedback 'in the loop' will make them feel involved in the improvement process and can help to minimize formal complaints and legal cases.
