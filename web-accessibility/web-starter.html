################### Planning and Managing Web Accessibility ######################################

1.  Introduction to discover and plan


>. The first steps to achieving accessibility goals in the discover and plan stage is to;
    1]] understand the current state of accessibility
    2]] build enthusiasm for it in your organization
    3]] create a plan and develop clear goals
    4]] start to build an environment that supports accessibility


>. These can further be stabilized through activities such as;
    
****************  A]] Explore your current environment <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>. Investigate your organization's current state of accessibility and your legal obligations to help understand the work ahead.
>. Before works and discussion with stakeholders can begin on accessibility several things need to be accessed.
>. These include; 

   A] Governance
 
    What accessibility laws, policies or industry standards apply to your organization?
    Is there an executive sponsor for accessibility in your organization? 

   B] Policy

   How well do the existing policies and processes support accessible practices; 
   for example, are there procurement policies to ensure purchasing of accessible tools and content, can accessibility be improved in design and development processes?

   C] Awareness and Capability

   What is the general awareness about accessibility in different parts of your organisation?
   What is the level of accessibility knowledge and expertise of the staff creating and maintaining your digital content? 
   What support is available to improve the situation, such as training or access to accessibility mentors? 

   D] Assets and tools
 

    What digital content do you have, such as websites, intranets, mobile apps, and digital communication channels? What is their current level of accessibility?
    Do staff have access to appropriate tools to assist in testing accessibility?


   E] Finance

  What, if any, budget is being spent on accessibility?


>. Note; finding all this information may feel like a big task, the more information you can collect about the state of accessibility in your organisation and its current commitment to accessibility, the better placed you will be to move forward with planning and implementing accessibility.


   #### Review digital content and products ###

>. Create a baseline for future work
>. Identify where training or additional expertise is needed.
>. Help clarify how big a problem exists
>. Show progress to stakeholders as you highlight existing problems and start to fix issues

>. This review may highlight instances of good practice, which identifies staff or suppliers who have accessibility skills to build on. 
>. It may also identify problems to be avoided in the future, even if your objectives involve completely replacing an existing website.

>. Accessibility checks can be performed at all stages of the process, not only when the website is completed.

    Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) — Provides a structured approach to help evaluate websites for accessibility.
    https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/


#### Reviewing Authoring Tools ###

>. In addition to reviewing your digital products and content, it is important to also understand how well authoring tools support you in creating and maintaining accessible content.

>. One of the first things that an organization should do when exploring their environment is create a list of their digital assets.
>. Accessibility requirements for tools used to create digital products and content are covered
   in the W3C's authoring tool accessibility guidelines, known as ATAG, for short.

########## Activity: Creating a digital Product List ##############

Create a digital product list

    1. Make a list of all the digital products your organization has that may need to be assessed for accessibility.
    2. If you have a large number of digital products, prioritize your digital products. Priority should be given to:
       a]  Products or content within products that provide critical content to your users, for example, the ability to access your bank account and do transactions online, the ability to look up your payslip in an online human resources system, information about emergency evacuation
       b]  Products or content within products that have a large number of users, although if the content is critical for users then that takes priority over the number of users
       c]  Product life-cycle - if a product due to be replaced or redeveloped in the near future, then you could fix only critical issues and provide support to users who still encounter barriers while the new and accessible product is build 









####################  B]] Set objectives and allocate resources ########################################
    



     i) Set objectives 

>. Create objectives that align with your accessibility goals and ensure you have the necessary resources to meet them
   
>. Once you've explored your environment to identify accessibility gaps, you can create measurable objectives that address these gaps within the organization’s digital content, processes, and policies. 
>. Objectives help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that successful delivery can be determined.

>. When setting objectives, include
    A] deliverables - what are the outcomes you want to achieve
    B] timelines - when are you going to achieve these deliverables
    C] success measures - how do you know when you've met your objective

>. Ensure that objectives have agreement and support from management. This will help secure the necessary resources, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. 
>. Objects should additionally help integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks, production workflows, or quality assurance processes.

>. Examples of objectives might include:

   >>  Develop an accessibility policy by year-end
   >> Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and enforce for all new digital procurement activities by year-end
   >> Review your primary website or mobile app and address any Level A and AA accessibility issues within 18 months
   >> Prepare and deliver an accessible content course for all content authors by May
   >> Update the design approval process to include accessibility considerations before June






ii) Secure budget and resources

>. Your budget and resource needs will depend on your accessibility goals and the extent of the work required to achieve them. For each activity, consider what resources are needed and ensure they are available.
>. Some things to consider include:

    i) Accessibility evaluations – how often they need to occur and how extensive they need to be
    ii) Evaluation with people – how will you involve users with disabilities in evaluations
    iii) Reviews of policies and procedures – how long will it take to determine which policies need to change, make the changes and implement the changes.
    iv) Recruitment – do you need to recruit accessibility specialists or coordinators to help you meet your accessibility goals
    v) Staff training – deliver general awareness-raising as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as design, development or content writing.
    vi) Tooling – adaptation or possible replacement of content authoring tools, such as the content management system (CMS), or acquiring accessibility evaluation tools
   vii) Experienced support – external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improve

>. Once the budget is determined, ensure that you have sufficient approval. Use your business case to help secure budget.

>. Ensure that the final budget includes how it will support you to meet your objectives and targets, and what return on investment could be expected. 
>. This might include better website performance, reduction in maintenance costs, higher sales, improved visitor statistics, or improved corporate social responsibility.




########################3 C]] Gather support and raise awareness #########################################

>. Engage and gather support from stakeholders and raise awareness about your accessibility program



############## Raise awareness about accessibility ############


  #### Gathering Support for accessibility

>. To achieve your accessibility goals, support needs to come from across the organization. 
>. Support can come from different areas, from design and development teams right through to senior management.
>. Regular communication with management and other stakeholders helps you maintain long-term support for your accessibility goals.


>. Key stakeholder and management support will simplify the process of introducing or improving accessibility. 
>. Management support will help with prioritization clashes, access to resources, and communication activities. 
>. Use your business case to help secure support from these groups.

>. Support for accessibility is often found among project teams involved in the creation of digital content. 
>. Encourage interest in these groups by exploring how accessibility has broad benefits. 
>. This will help increase the enthusiasm for accessibility and create more advocates or champions.


>. Support doesn't only come from internal stakeholders. It is also important to engage external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. For example:

    A] Negotiate and set expectations with suppliers to better support you with accessibility
    B] Develop meaningful relationships with your customers and users to understand what is important to them
    C] Provide feedback channels to engage with advocacy groups



>. Communicate your efforts publicly to help set expectations and increase internal commitment for accessibility. 





      ###### Raise awareness about accessibility

>. A lack of awareness is a common reason for organizations not adopting accessible practices.
>. Many people may know little or nothing about accessibility. Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on digital accessibility. Others may not be aware of the value that accessibility brings. 
>. A general introduction to accessibility, including your organizational goals, will improve awareness. It will also build enthusiasm for the task.


>. Building awareness about accessibility and disability needs to be a going activity, not a one-off. 
>. An ongoing program keeps accessibility front-of-mind for everyone and makes sure the importance and awareness of accessibility are also reinforced for new staff.



   >>>>>>>>>>> ideas for raising awareness about accessibility and disability in your organization include <<<<<<<<<,

    A] Invite people with disability to share their lived experience of disability, how they use technology and how it impacts their lives; make sure people are compensated for their time
    B] Invite accessibility leaders and champions from other organizations to talk about how they have raised awareness and capability in their organization
    C] Ask accessibility vendors to come in and share their experience on digital accessibility – make sure to be clear this is not an opportunity for a sales pitch!
    D] Deliver introduction to accessibility sessions tailored to the accessibility interests of your audience, such as managers, researchers, designers, developers, testers, and content authors
    E] Use good quality videos such as the Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards and Web Accessibility Perspectives videos to introduce accessibility and start a group conversation about your accessibility initiatives

>. You can also encourage your organization to celebrate international days related to disability and inclusion, 
   such as International Day of People with Disability (3 December) and Global Accessibility Awareness Day (third Thursday in May).



############################  D]] Create your accessibility policy ####################################

>. Create an accessibility policy for creating, managing and delivering accessible digital content

>. An accessibility policy captures your goals and targets for accessibility in your organization.








############################ E]] Create your accessibility statements  ########################################

>. Create accessibility statements for websites, mobile applications or other digital content 






############################# F]] Create a monitoring framework ########################################

>. Create a standard way of monitoring and reporting on progress against your accessibility goals.

>. To track progress, create a standard way of monitoring and reporting findings to stakeholders across your organization. 

>. Milestones can help you measure your progress. Ensure that each milestone has specific and measurable criteria to indicate what progress has occurred.


>. Some example criteria include:

   A]  number of WCAG Success Criteria passed, and their level
   B]  number of complaints received related to accessibility
   C]  calls handled from people who were unable to process their application online
   D]  positive social media comments on the accessibility of service
   E]  training sessions on accessibility delivered to the staff


>. Ensure that accessibility progress is part of standard reporting for all parts of your organization that have accessibility responsibility.

>.It is useful to develop a standard report structure to capture the measure of accessibility for websites or tools. 
>. This allows for comparisons between different websites, as well as between different versions of the same website.

>. For long-term or ongoing goals, you need to plan regular monitoring to ensure that achieved goals do not slip. When goals aren't being met and issues are identified, ask why these issues are occurring. 

Some questions to consider include:

    >> Are issues caused by staff members who have not had adequate training?
    >> Are they as a result of a change in the content management system (CMS)?
    >>  Are the requirements of the publishing process unclear?


>. Plan for regular reviews to monitor progress over time. Assign responsibility for the checks and ensure there are clear escalation paths for issues
