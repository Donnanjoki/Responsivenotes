        2] How improving accessibility can boost your reputation at the same time as making the user experience better for many more users
        3]] Return on Investment (ROI) of accessibility
        4]] How accessibility can be part of your Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

Focus topics: 
        >> brand reputation
        >> human centered design and
        >> the legal issues associated with accessibility;



*********************** Accessibility is a necessity *********************************************

>. Accessibility is a necessity for people with disabilities, and is helpful and often necessary for many others.

>. So many different people and groups benefit from digital accessibility, not only people with disabilities and 
older users, but also - 
       
          1]] people using a mobile device which doesn’t always act in the same way as a fixed desktop computer or laptop;
          2]] people with low literacy or who are not fluent in the language;
          3]] people with low bandwidth connections or using older technologies;
          4]] new and infrequent users of digital material;
          5]] people with situational limitations, for example they are in a noisy environment or one that has low light;
          6]] those who have a temporary disability such as a broken arm;
          7]] people who are in a situation where they can’t interact with content easily, for example videos with no captions and
          8]] people who may not consider that their ‘normal’ is not quite the same as that of other people and not consider themselves to have a disability, 
              but still require some accommodations e.g. lowered vision ability due to age, or a slight tremor that affects their hands and arms.
       

>. All of these users are not in the typical ‘person with a disability’ sector, but both are affected by the lack of accessibility considerations of the website.

>> When a user is unable to complete their business, this may result in:
      1]] Total frustration and possible anxiety for the user as well as the waste of their time
      2]] Loss of privacy/security for the user
      3]] Loss of reputation for the organization
      4]] Loss of revenue for the organization
      5]]  Possible litigation for the organization



******************* The electronic curb-cut*************************************

>. Digital accessibility is best understood as the electronic curb-cut, the digital equivalent of the wheelchair ramp for sidewalks.  

>. The provision of digital access is often termed the ‘electronic curb cut’.
>. The need of the person in a wheelchair to be able to navigate efficiently, is the same at that moment as the need of the mother pushing a baby in a pram, 
  a person pulling a suitcase or a delivery man with a cartload of products. 
  The design improvements made to allow for the curb cut for wheelchair users benefits many others at the same time.

>. Example, Alexander Graham Bell, the developer of the first telephone, worked with sound technology to help his deaf mother and wife [2], 
          and Pellegrino Turri developed one of the first working typewriters to help a blind friend write more legibly [3].  
          Both of these inventions benefit many people and have long been considered mainstream technology in turn leading to newer innovations in both products. 

>. This can also be considered under situational limitations such as, the needs at the moment for the person who has one arm, might be the same as that of the person with their arm in a sling, or carrying an infant.
   While the severity of other implications are very different, at that time, they all need to be able to operate with one arm. 



*************************** Accessibility and the older people **************************************************************

>. There are numerous instances of an overlap between the needs of people with disability and people who are older. 
>. For instance, people who are older are often found to have issues affecting their vision.  
    While many people are born with or develop vision decline over their lifetime, it becomes more common for older users whose eyesight deteriorates as they age.  

    ### Overlap between the needs of senior and users with disabilities ###
  
       1]] Vision: including reduced contrast sensitivity, color perception, 
                   and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages;

       2]] Physical Ability - including reduced dexterity and fine motor control, 
                              making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets;

       3]] Hearing - including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and separating sounds, 
                      making it difficult to hear podcasts and other audio, especially when there is background music; and

       4]] Cognitive Ability - including reduced short-term memory, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, 
                               making it difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks.


>. These aspects overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. So, websites, applications, and tools that are accessible to people with disabilities are also more accessible to older users as well.



*************************** Accessibility and mobile users *********************************************************

>. Mobile means more than just typical mobile phones. This include devices such as 
       >> Phones and tablets
       >> digital TVs
       >> wearable devices such as smart watches
       >> Devices in car dashboards and airplane set-backs

>. These come with a wide range of passible access issues such as;
         >> touchscreens
         >> small screen-sizes
         >> different input modalities, including speech and 3D touch enables by pressure sensors
         >> devices use in a different setting such as bright sunlight and more

    Examples of issues faced by people with mobile devices by disabilities include;

        >> A user with print-based disability such as being unable to click on small targets (or links) 
           who is unable to click on a link on their mobile because the pinch-to-zoom feature has been disabled.

        >> A wheelchair user who must have their mobile device set in a holder on their chair because of an inability to 
           physically hold the device is frustrated because the mobile website only works when the mobile device is in the vertical (or portrait) mode.

        >> A blind user is trying to fill out a form on their mobile device, but the form fields have placeholder text without a properly coded label.
           (Placeholder text is the example text placed inside the form field). As they don’t know what to put in the form field, they are unable to complete the form.

        >> In some parts of the world, many people only access the Web through a mobile device because they do not 
           have access to desktop or laptop computers. For these users, accessibility for mobile is a necessity.



>. It is important to remember that many people are now accessing the Web primarily from their mobile devices. 
   If a website is inaccessible for people with disabilities and others, the user will either go to a different website for the product or service, 
   or if there is no alternative such as for a government website, they will be unable to complete the task independently.


    ### Activity ##

    >> Build a business case:
    Start by gathering some ideas of what you could use in a business case to justify addressing digital accessibility for your organization.  
    If you don’t currently work for an organization, or if you prefer, assume a hypothetical situation for the travel company from the video segments in the module. 

     
        A]] Find an example of a feature that was originally designed for accessibility and has become mainstream, such as text to speech, voice controls, captions, etc. 
        B]] Describe 3 potential clients for your business that, due to their personal circumstances, need a booking system that is accessible.  Describe them in terms of their age, mobility, access challenges... and any other factors that are appropriate for your client base.
        C]] Look at your competitors' websites, how do you compare in terms of accessibility?
        D]] When you are building your business case, you will need to know what laws and policies apply in your business location. Work through these activities and add the relevant information to your business case.

         >>  Notes <<
        >. It's not finished when you go live.
        >> It's ongoing, people need to be trained or over time they fall back into - bad habits, so I'd allow for that in your budgeting.
        >> Cross-departmental 
        >> Some form of first-hand experience such as focus group with people with disabilities
        >> Get buy-in from shareholders to understand the why - such as staff, management
        >> Testing is crucial hence don't leave it to the very end -
        >> Assess your content management system and plugins for accessibility



###################### Understanding the Return on Investment(ROI) Potential #####################################

So how can digital accessibility benefit;
   1]] boost business by increasing your share of the market
   2]] Enhance brand reputation
   3]] Drive innovation
   4]] Prevent possible litigation
   5]] Set you apart as a leader in your industry


## Convincing the management:

   >. Talk about accessibility internally and how it affects our customers
   >. Showcase we do not just demonstrate corporate social responsibility- we act on it



******************* Accessibility and brand reputation *******************************************


>. There are over 1 billion people around the world with disabilities, and they have a considerable spending power. 
>. That is approximately (15-20)% - Many disabilities that affect the ability to successfully use websites are not obvious. 
    For example, a person who is color blind, or a young person with epilepsy whose seizures can be triggered by flashing lights.

>. Many of these people are not necessarily those we usually think of (or think of themselves) as having a disability. 

>. It has been said that we all have a field of influence of at least 100 people, who all influence 100 and so on. We know that ‘bad news carries fast’, but good news also carries. 
>. The person who has a positive experience with a website will likely tell others, who tell others and so on. 
>. So, if a person with a disability was able to easily book an airplane ticket online, they will not only tell others in their disability groups, but family members, friends and work colleagues who will pass on that message. 
   This can equate to a huge possible increase of business.



******************************** Accessibility and human-centered design ****************************************

>. To address accessibility, organizations need to better understand users and employ user-centered design processes – adopting user-centered design is essential for people with disabilities but also allows inclusion of many more people.

>. User-centered design is related to UX or ‘user experience’.  In terms of digital development, it is about putting the focus on the needs of the user at the front of the design process. In short, it requires that we understand the needs of our users and design with that in mind.

>. Digital accessibility can be defined as ‘usability for people with disabilities’. When usability and accessibility are combined, a product is designed to benefit as many people as possible and meets the needs of people with disabilities.

>. Digital accessibility is an important part of the user-centered design process and should be considered at every stage of the development of a product or service.

>. Good design is a cyclic process: Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Evolution, Repeat.




********************************* Accessibility and legislation ****************************************************

>. Most countries around the world have adopted and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
>. The UNCRPD has been signed by 164 countries and ratified (or made legally binding) by 180.


>. The UNCRPD was adopted in December 2006 and entered into force in 2008. It builds upon previous documents related to people with disabilities such as the World Programme of Action on Disabled Persons (1982).

>. The Convention was adopted as a response to what was deemed an overlooked development challenge. 
   The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 25% of the world’s population is affected by disability, 
   and 80% of the world’s people with disabilities live in low-income countries. 
   It was deemed that people with disabilities were being denied their human rights.

>. UNCRPD is the document most cited in respect to digital accessibility. It is a commitment by those countries which have signed and ratified the Convention that they will abide by the policies.

>. In addition to being signatories to the UNCRPD and agreeing to abide by that Convention, most countries have adopted their own methods for governing digital accessibility internally.
    For some countries, the requirements only apply to government organizations, and in others, it applies to both public and private organizations. However most require compliance with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 or 2.1. 


    Example:
       >> The United Kingdom has the Equality Act, 2010 which is a non-discrimination law applying to both public and private sector organizations and is based on WCAG 2.0.
       >> The European Union currently has the Web Accessibility Directive and the European Accessibility Act, which use WCAG 2.1.
       >> Canada uses the Canadian Human Rights Act of 1985 which applies to both public and private sector organizations.
       >> Canada also has the Policy on Communications and Federal Identity, 2016 which applies to government organizations and is based on WCAG 2.0.
