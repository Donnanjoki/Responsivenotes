CHAPTER 10 - SVG I(Scalable Vector Graphics)
******************

>. SVG aids in responsive web design and providing pin-sharp and future-proof graphical assets for all screen resolutions.

>. With graphics saved in JPEG, GIF or PNG the shortcomings limit these images definitions.

>. SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML [XML10]. SVG allows for three
types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (for paths consisting of straight lines and curves),
images, and text.

>. SVG allows two-dimensional images to be described in code as vector points, hence these points can scale to any size without loss of fidelity.
>. Also in terms of data SVGs tend to be tiny compared to JPEG, GIFs or PNG file.


### The root SVG element ###
>. The root SVG element has attributes for width, height and viewBox.
    <svg width="198px" height="188px" viewBox="0 0 198 188"

>> The width and height of the SVG effectively create a viewport. 
>. While the viewBox defines the coordinate system in which all the shapes of the SVG are governed.
   >> You can think of the viewBox values 0 0 198 188 as describing the top-left and
     bottom-right areas of a rectangle. The first two values, known technically as min-x and min-y,
     describe the top-left corner, while the second two, known technically as width and height, de-
     scribe the bottom-right corner. 

     >> Having the viewBox attribute allows you to do things like zoom an image in or out



    ### g element ###

>. The g element is used to group other elements together.
>. or example, if you were drawing an SVG
of a car, you might group the shapes that make up an entire wheel inside a g tag.

  // <g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-
rule="evenodd" sketch:type="MSPage">



   ### The defs tag ###
      // Example: <defs></defs>

>. Note, despite being empty, they are an important element as they are used to store definitions of all manner of reusable content
such as gradients, symbols, paths and more.



    ### SVG shapes ###
>. SVGs have a number of ready-made shapes such as
      1] path
      2] rect
      3] circle
      4] ellipse
      5] line
      6] polyline
      7] polygon


  ### Inserting SVGs into your web pages ###

   a]] Using an img tag
   ********************
>. This makes the svg behave more or less like any other image, hence there isn't much else to say.
   // <img src="mySconeVector.svg" alt="Amazing line art of a scone" />

b]] Using an object tag
************************\
>.The object tag is the container recommended by the W3C for holding non-HTML content in a
web page.
  // Example: <object data="img/svgfile.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
                     <span class="fallback-info">Your browser doesn't support SVG</span>
  </object>

>. The data attribute is where you link out to the SVG asset in the same manner you would link to
any other asset. The type attribute describes the MIME (internet media type) type relevant to
the content. 
>. In this instance, image/svg+xml is the MIME type to indicate that the data is SVG.
You can add a width and height attribute too if you want to constrain the size of the SVG with
this container

>. With an object tag, it can be accessed with javascript and also provides a simple mechanism for when
the browser doesn't understand data type.


c]] Inserting an SVG as a background image 
*******************************************
>. SVGs can be used as background images in CSS, much the same as any other image format (PNG,
JPG, or GIF).

    // Example: .item {
        background-image: url('image.svg');
    }

>. If you need be that you have to support browsers that don't support SVGs then we can use css feature queries.
    .item {
        background-image: url('image.png');
    }
    @supports (fill: black) {
        .item {
            background-image: url(image.svg);
        }
    }

>. The @supports rule works here because fill is an SVG property, so if the browser understands
that, it will take the lower rule over the first



   ### Generating image sprites ###

>. A good recommendation tool for generating image sprites or data URI assets is iconizr - (https://iconizr.com)
>. This tool gives you complete control of your resultant SVG and fallback PNG assets.
>. You can have the SVGs and fallback PNG files output as data URIs
or image sprites, and it even includes the requisite JavaScript snippet for loading the correct asset
if you opt for data URIs.

** Note: a better way to animate SVGs background images dynamically or to inject the vales via javascript is to opt in for inserting 
SVG data "inline" into HTML.


    
    ### Inserting an SVG inline ### 

>. Inserting SVG as markup into your documents is probably the most versatile option in terms of
accessing the broadest range of SVG features.
  // Example: 
     <div>
        <h3> Inserted 'inline': </h3>
        <span class="inlineSVG">
            <svg id="svgInline" width="198" height="188" viewBox="0 0 198 188"
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.
            w3.org/1999/xlink">
         <title>Star 1</title>
             <g class="star_Wrapper" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd">
                 <path id="star_Path" stroke="#979797" stroke-width="3"
                   fill="#F8E81C" d="M99 154l-58.78 30.902 11.227-65.45L3.894
                    73.097l65.717-9.55L99 4l29.39 59.55 65.716 9.548-47.553
                     46.353 11.226 65.452z" />
            </g>
        </svg>
        </span>
     </div>

>. Note if you remove the width and height attributes on the svg element, the svg will scale fluidly to fit the containing element.







    #### What you can do with SVG insertion method (inline, object, background and img) ####

>. SVG differ  from other graphical assets, and can behave differently depending on the way they have been inserted into a page.

>. There are 4 main ways to place SVG onto a page.

1] inside an img tag
2] inside an object tag
3] As a background-image
4] inline

## Caveats to consider
*************************

1] When using an SVG inside an object, you can use an external style sheet to style the SVG, but you have to link to that style sheet within the SVG.
2] You can use SVGs in an external asset (which is cacheable), although those external assests cannot be manipulated by javascript.
3] A media query inside the style section of an inlined SVG works on the size of the document it lives and not the size of the SVG itself


## Note>. SVGs will always render as sharp as the viewing device will allow, and regardless of the manner of insertion.

>. Resolution independence is typically a reason enough to use SVGs.





### SMIL Animation ###

>. SMIL - Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language ; SMIL animation is a way to define animations for an SVG within the SVG document itself.

   // Example: 
   < g class="star-wrapper" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd">
      <animate
         xlink:href="#star_path"
         attributeName="fill"
         attributeType="XML"
         begin="Os"
         dur= "2s"
         fill="freeze"
         from="#F8E81C"
         to="#14805e"
         />
         <path
         id="star_Path"
        stroke="#979797"
        stroke-width="3"
        fill="#F8E81C"
        d="M99 154l-58.78 30.902 11.227-65.45L3.894 73.097l65.717-9.55L99
        4l29.39 59.55 65.716 9.548-47.553 46.353 11.226 65.452z"
        />
       </g>


>. Note theoretically, SMIL is good to use for some use cases, I tend to quarantine it mentally
in a “use as a last resort” technique.




     ### STYLING an SVG with an external style sheet ###

>. Note styling SVG with external CSS isn't possible when the SVG is included via an img tag or as a background-image, apart
from Internet Explorer.
>. Hence its only possible when SVGs are inserted via an object tag or inline.

>. There ate two syntaxes to link external sheet from an SVG.
    A] In this you typically add this in the defs section.
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />

    B] <?xml-stylesheet href="style.css" type="text/css"?>
    then add the above in your file.

    <? xml-stylesheet href="styles.css type="text/css"?>
    <svg
       width="198"
       height="188"
       viewBox="0 0 198 188"
       xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
       xmls:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"





     ### STYLING an SVG with an internal styles ###

>. They should be placed within the defs element. As SVG is XML- based, it's safe to '
to include the Character Data Marker (CDATA).
>. The CDATA tells the browser that the info within the character data can be interpreted as XML markup, but should not.

   // Example 
   <defs>
    <style type="text/css">
        <![CDATA[
              #star_path {
                stroke: red;
              }
              ]]>
    </style>
</defs>




           ### ANIMATING SVGs ###

           1]] with Css

           >. You can get quite far animating SVGs with CSS animations. However, when you want to add in-
teractivity or synchronize several events, it’s generally best to lean on JavaScript. And the good
news is that there are great libraries that make animating SVGs really easy.

           2]] with Javascript

>. With an SVG inserted into the page via an object tag or inline, it’s possible to manipulate the SVG
directly or indirectly with JavaScript.

>. By indirectly it means that its possible with JS to change a class on or above the SVG that would cause aa CSS animation to start.
    // Example:
         svg {
            /* no animation*/
         }

         .added-with-js svg {
            /* animation */
         }


>. If directly: lets say you want to animate one or two things independently, then you can decide to either it would be lighter code-wise to write the Javascript by hand

>. Additionally if you need to animate lots of elements or synchronize the animation of elements as if on a timelines, then JS libraries can be handy.
>. To note; you will need to judge whether the weight of including the library in your page can be justified for the goal you are trying to achieve.
   Note you can use GreenSock  an animation library which simplifies the animation.

>. 








    ### Optimizing SVGs ###

>. As conscientious developers, we want to ensure that assets are as small as possible. The easiest
way to do this with SVGs is to make use of automation tools that can optimize various particulars
of SVG documents.

>. You can use tools such as; SVG0 - (https://github.com/svg/svgo)
                               SVGOMG - (https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).
                               iconizr (https://iconizr.com) 



    ### SVG Implementation Tips ###

 1]] If you have no need to animate your SVGs, opt for an image sprite of your assets or a data
   URI style sheet. It’s far easier to provide fallback assets and they almost always perform
   better from a performance perspective

2]] Automate as many steps in the asset creation process as possible; this reduces human
    error and produces predictable results faster.

3]] To insert static SVGs in a project, pick a single delivery mechanism and stick to it (image
    sprite, data URI, or inline). It can become a burden to produce some assets one way and
    some another and maintain the various implementations.

4]] There is no easy “one size fits all” choice with SVG animation. For occasional and simple
   animations, use CSS. For complex interactive or timeline-style animations, lean on a
   proven library such as GreenSock. Or, look at using the JavaScript Web Animations API.


   >. Note: These are just guides, not gospel. There will be times when you need to make a choice that may
           seem counter-intuitive to conventional wisdom. But at least if you have taken in the details here,
           you will be able to make informed choices when it comes to working with SVG.
