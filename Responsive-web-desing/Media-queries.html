<!--
 Chapter 3: Media Queries and Container Queries

>. Media queries allows us to target specific CSS styles depending on the capabilities of a device.
>. We can change the way content is displayed based on things such as:
        a]] Viewport width
        b]] screen aspect ratio
        c]] orientation (landscape or portrait)


    ### The meta viewport tag ###

>. The meta tag was introduced by Apple in 2007, and its purpose was to provide a way for web pages to communicate to mobile browsers how they would like the web browsers to render the page.
>. Example: 
     <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=2.0,width=device-width" />

       // breakdown:
           1. the name "viewport" tell the browser this tag is dealing with the viewport.
           2. the content="initial-scale=2.0" states to scale the content to twice its size.
           3. the width=device-width part tells the browser that the width of the page should be equal to the device-width

>.The meta tag can also be used to control the amount a user can zoom in and out of a page.
   // Example: Allows users to go as large as three times the device and small as half the device width.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=3, minimum scale=0.5"
        />

        // You can also disable users form zooming at all:
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"
        />

>. Note zooming is an important accessibility requirement for users with reduced visual acuity, hence do no add feature "user-scalable-no".

   // Example:
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />

>. In the above example the scale is changed to 1.0, meaning that the mobile browser will render the page at 100% percent of the width of all the supported mobile browsers.


   ### Why media queries are needed for a responsive web design ###

>. A media query consists of a media type and zero or more expressions that check for the conditions of
particular media features. Among the media features that can be used in media queries are ‘width’,
‘height’, and ‘color’. By using media queries, presentations can be tailored to a specific range of output
devices without changing the content itself

>. Media queries are thought as the basic conditional logic for css.


     ### Basic conditional logic in CSS ###

>. True programming languages all have some facility in which one of two or more possible situations is catered for.
>. This is usually taken care of by some conditional logic known as control flow - typified by an if/else statement.

>. Hence such statements accompanied by if/else are simple conditional statement with two possible and equally desirable results based on two equal possible eventualities.


### Media Query Syntax ###

>. A default color in the mediaq. example is defined first, outside of a media query. Then when any of the media queries are "true", the styles inside the media query overwrite the default.

>. The basic syntax of a media query is simple when you get used to it. You use the @media at rule to communicate a media query and then write the media test in parentheses. 
The test must pass in order for the styles within the curly braces to be applied.

a]] Media queries in link tags

>.Here the media query is found on the head section of the markup
 // Example:
        <link 
            rel="stylesheet"
            media="screen and (orientation: portrait)"
            href="potrait-screen.css"
            />
            This media query is asking. "Are you screen and is your orientation potrait?"


  b]] Media query on an @import at-rule

  >. Here the same rule still applies but on an @import statement:
       @import url("portrait-screen.css") screen and (orientation: portrait);


### Note: By using the @import at-rule in css makes the browser request the relevant file from the network hence incresing the number of HTTP requests, alternatively affecting the load speed.


c]] Media queries in a css file

// Example:
    @media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
      /* style here*/
    }

d]] Inverting media query logic

>. You can reverse the logic of any media query expression by adding not to the beginning of the media query.
  /// Example:
      <link
          rel="stylesheet"
          media="not screen and (orientation:portrait)"
          href="potrait-screen.css"
      />


e]] Combining media queries

>. Its possible to string multiple expressions together.

// Example:
  <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      media="screen and (orientation: portrait) and (min-width: 800px)"
      href="800wide-potrait-scree.css"
   />   

 // Example: @media (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {
   /**/
 }  

 or to limit style to devices with a screen, chain the media feature to the screen media type

 @media screen and (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) {
   /* */
 }


   ## Note ##

>.Unless you want to target styles to particular media types, just leave the screen and
part out.
    // Example: @media (min-width: 750px) {
      /*styles*/
    }

>. Media queries are case-sensitive.
>. Media types: applies for: all, print, screen. The type is optional(assumed to be all) except when using the not or only logical operator.
>. You can also combine multiple media queries into a single rule by separating them with commas. 



g]] Creating complex media queries

>. Sometimes you may want to create a media query that depends on multiple conditions. 
This is where the logical operators come in: not, and, and only. Furthermore, you can combine multiple media queries into a comma-separated list;
 this allows you to apply the same styles in different situations. 

>. The "and" operator can be used to combine multiple media features into a single media query.
>. While the not operator negates a media query. The only operator prevents older browsers from applying the styles.

>. In most cases, the all media type is used by default when no other type is specified. However, if you use the not or only operators, you must explicitly specify a media type. 




h]] Testing for multiple queries 
>. You can use a comma-separated list to apply styles when the user's device matches any of the various media types, features or states.
    // Example:
        @media (min-height: 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) {
         /* style*/
        }

#### Improving Compatibility with older browsers ###
>. The "only" keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the given styles.
>. It has no effect on modern browsers.




### What Media queries test for ###

1] width: the viewport width
2] height:  the viewport height
3] orientation: this capability checks whether a device is portrait or landscape in orientation. 
4] aspect-ratio:  the ratio of width to height based on the viewport width and height. A 16:9 widescreen display can be written as aspect-ration: 16/9.
5] color: The number of bits per color component. E.g min-colo: 16 will check that the device has 16-bit color.
6] color-index: The number of entries in the color lookup table (the table is how a device
               changes one set of colors to another) of the device. Values must be numbers and cannot
               be negative.
7] monochrome: This capability tests how many bits per pixel are in a monochrome frame buffer.  The value would be an integer and cannot be negative e.g. monochrome: 2
8] resolution: This capability can be used to test screen or print resolution; for example,
              min-resolution: 300dpi. It can also accept measurements in dots per centimeter; for
              example, min-resolution: 118dpcm.
9] scan: This can be either progressive or interlace, features largely particular to TVs. For
         example, a 720p HD TV (the “p” part of 720p indicates “progressive”) could be targeted
         with scan: progressive, while a 1080i HD TV (the “i” part of 1080i indicates “interlaced”)
could    be targeted with scan: interlace.
10 grid:  This capability indicates whether or not the device is grid orbitmap-based.


>. The above features except grid and scan can be prefixed with max or min to create ranges.
   // Example: @import url("tiny.css") screen and (min-width: 200px) and (max-width: 360px);




   ### Interaction Media Features ###

>. These features are concerned with pointing devices and hover capability
    
     a]] The pointer media feature 

>. There are three possible states for the pointer feature: that is none, coarse and fine.

>. A coarse pointer might be a finger on a touchscreen device. Or a cursor from a games console that doesn't have the fine-grained control of
 something like a mouse 
    // Example: @media (pointer: coarse) {
      /* styles for when coarse pointer is present*/
    }

>. A fine pointer device might be a mouse but could also be a a stylus pen or any future fine-grained
pointer mechanism: 
    // Example: 
       @media (pointer: fine) {
         /* styles for when fine pointer is present*/
       }


>. Note: The safest bet is always to assume users are using touch-based input and size user
interface elements accordingly. That way, even if they are using a mouse they will
have no difficulty using the interface with ease. If, however, you assume mouse
input and don’t provide affordance for coarse pointers, it might make for a difficult
user experience




   b]] The hover media feature

>. This tests the device’s ability to hover over elements on the screen. If the user has multiple inputs at their disposal (touch and mouse, for example),
characteristics of the primary input are used. Here are the possible values and example code:

>. For users that have no ability to hover, we can target styles at them with a value of none:

// Example: @media (hover: none) {
   /* styles for when the users cannot hover*/
}

>. or choose to make the non-hover scenario the default then add hover styles for devices that take advantage of them.
 
@media (hover) {
   /* styles for when user can hover*/
}


     ### Preference media feature ###

a]] The prefers-color-scheme media feature

      
>. These cater to enhancing accessibility.
>. In the last couple of years, popular operating systems for both desktop and mobile computers
have given users the option of a dark mode. 
>. To supplement this, operating systems expose this user preference to the browser by way of the prefers-color-scheme media feature.
>. At present there are three possible preferences: light, dark, and no-preference. 

    // Example: body {
      background-color: #e4e4e4;
      color: #545454;
    }

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      body {
         background-color: #333;
         color: #ddd;
      }
    }


    b]] The prefers-reduced-motion feature

>. If a user has set their device to minimize the amount of motion it provides in its interface and system 
interactions, this information is exposed to CSS via the prefers-reduced-motion media query.

>. There are only two settings: no-preference or reduce.

>. If you find yourself writing more than the occasional animation or transition, it’s well worth
wrapping such styles up in a no-preference variant like this:

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
   /*animation code here*/
}

>. If you want subtler animation to your users, you could write your animation code, then provide another that overwrites the first for users that would
like a subtler version
 .ele {
   animation: bezerk 1s;
 }
@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
   .ele {
      animation: subtle 1s;
   }
}

>.    This media query is a great tool for users sensitive to animations and movements, whether for medical reasons such as vestibular motion disorders or 
purely from a personal preference pov.


### Container queries ###

>. When working with responsive designs, its the width of the container that we are typically interested in.

>. Note confirm is updates have been passed for browser user on container queries.

>. In order for containers to be query-able, we first need to tell the browser how the container should be "contained".

>. Note the container property is actually a shorthand for setting two properties: container-name and container-type

// Example:
   @container main (inline-size > 500px) {
      .thing {
         /*styles */
      }
   }
