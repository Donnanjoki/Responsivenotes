<!-- Chapter 2: Writing HTML Markup -->

<!-- 
    HTML: HyperText Markup Language:
    This is a language that allows content to be marked up in a manner that makes it understandable to 
    technology and then in turn, humans.
    >. Writing good quality HTML is a prerequisite of anything that you want to be accessible to all users of the web.
     
    // The basic Structure of an HTML page looks like this
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <title>Web Page Structure</title>
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>
    
>. When writing HTML, you will be marking up or writing content inside a series of tags or elements.
>. A few elements, like the meta tag, are known as void elements, these don't wrap around anything hence are self-closing.
>. Presently the void tags include: 
area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track and wbr.

  ### Getting the start of HTML pages right ###

>. Understanding what each syntax in a html page is for is more important than memorizing it.
>. The components include;
      1]] The doctype: opens up the html document
      2]] The HTML tag and lang attribute: the former is the root tag of the document, while the latter is specifies the language
      of the document.
      3]] Character coding: this tells the browser how to parse the information contained within.
      Its a void element hence doesn't require a closing tag.
      Its value should always be <meta charset="utf-8" />


   ### Sensible Approach to HTML Markup

>. Note clarity in authoring code should trump brevity.
>. Despite HTML5's looser syntax, its good habit to checkup your markup for any basic human errors such as
missing or mismatched tags, missing alt attributes, incorrectly nested elements among others. 
>. Use https://validator.w3.org/ for validating your code.

>. The anchor tag is the tag used to link from the document a user is on to another document elsewhere
on the internet, or another point in the same document.
