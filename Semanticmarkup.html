<!-- Chapter 2: Writing HTML Markup -->

<!-- 
    HTML: HyperText Markup Language:
    This is a language that allows content to be marked up in a manner that makes it understandable to 
    technology and then in turn, humans.
    >. Writing good quality HTML is a prerequisite of anything that you want to be accessible to all users of the web.
     
    // The basic Structure of an HTML page looks like this
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <title>Web Page Structure</title>
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>
    
>. When writing HTML, you will be marking up or writing content inside a series of tags or elements.
>. A few elements, like the meta tag, are known as void elements, these don't wrap around anything hence are self-closing.
>. Presently the void tags include: 
area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track and wbr.

  ### Getting the start of HTML pages right ###

>. Understanding what each syntax in a html page is for is more important than memorizing it.
>. The components include;
      1]] The doctype: opens up the html document
      2]] The HTML tag and lang attribute: the former is the root tag of the document, while the latter is specifies the language
      of the document.
      3]] Character coding: this tells the browser how to parse the information contained within.
      Its a void element hence doesn't require a closing tag.
      Its value should always be <meta charset="utf-8" />


   ### Sensible Approach to HTML Markup

>. Note clarity in authoring code should trump brevity.
>. Despite HTML5's looser syntax, its good habit to checkup your markup for any basic human errors such as
missing or mismatched tags, missing alt attributes, incorrectly nested elements among others. 
>. Use https://validator.w3.org/ for validating your code.

>. The anchor tag is the tag used to link from the document a user is on to another document elsewhere
on the internet, or another point in the same document.
>. Unlike the old html the new HTML allows us to wrap various elements as a group rather than individual elements.
  
    // Example: <a href = "index.html">
                    <h2>The home page</h2>
                    <p>This paragraph also links to the home page</p>
                    <img src="home-image.png" alt="A rendering of the home page" />
                </a>


>. A limitation to the a tag is that you cant wrap one tag within another tag or other interactive elements such as buttons and you
cant wrap a form in a tag either.



#### New Sematic Elements in HTML5 ####

>.Semantics: a branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning.
>. Knowing that elements exist to convey a certain meaning is a huge part os making accessible websites and applications.
 
   **** Categories ****
   1. Sectioning Elements: These are the kind of elements which are used for headers, footer and sidebar areas. 
   2. Grouping Elements: These are used as wrap associated elements. e.g paragraphs, blockquotes and content
   3. Text-level Elements:  These are used to designate particulars e.g bold, italic text or code.



        ### Sectioning Elements ###
From: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-main-element
and responsive web design book

>>>>  The <main> element <<<<

>. This element reps the dominant content of the document.
>.The main content area of a document includes content that is unique to that document and excludes
content that is repeated across a set of documents such as site navigation links, copyright info, site logos,
and banners and search forms(unless the document or application's main function is that of a search form.)
>. There shouldn't be more that one main on each page that doesn't have the hidden attribute specified.
>. Also it shouldn't be used as a descendant of child elements of some of the other semantic HTML elements such as 
article, aside, header, footer or nav.


>>>> The <section> element <<<<

>. This element is used to define a generic section of a document or application.
>. This element is not meant for styling purposes, hence if you need to wrap an element to nearly style it then a div would suffice.
>. A use case is it is used in wrapping elements for visual components. It provides a simple way to see the beginning and the end of components in the markup.
>. A general rule is that section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.
>. Example of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box or the numbered sections of a thesis.
>. A web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, new items and contact information.
