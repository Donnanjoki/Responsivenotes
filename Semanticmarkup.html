<!-- Chapter 2: Writing HTML Markup -->

<!-- 
    HTML: HyperText Markup Language:
    This is a language that allows content to be marked up in a manner that makes it understandable to 
    technology and then in turn, humans.
    >. Writing good quality HTML is a prerequisite of anything that you want to be accessible to all users of the web.
     
    // The basic Structure of an HTML page looks like this
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <title>Web Page Structure</title>
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>
    
>. When writing HTML, you will be marking up or writing content inside a series of tags or elements.
>. A few elements, like the meta tag, are known as void elements, these don't wrap around anything hence are self-closing.
>. Presently the void tags include: 
area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track and wbr.
