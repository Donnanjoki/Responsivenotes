<!-- Chapter 2: Writing HTML Markup -->

<!-- Sources: https://whatwg.org/ -->
<!-- 
    HTML: HyperText Markup Language:
    This is a language that allows content to be marked up in a manner that makes it understandable to 
    technology and then in turn, humans.
    >. Writing good quality HTML is a prerequisite of anything that you want to be accessible to all users of the web.
     
    // The basic Structure of an HTML page looks like this
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <title>Web Page Structure</title>
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>
    
>. When writing HTML, you will be marking up or writing content inside a series of tags or elements.
>. A few elements, like the meta tag, are known as void elements, these don't wrap around anything hence are self-closing.
>. Presently the void tags include: 
area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track and wbr.

  ### Getting the start of HTML pages right ###

>. Understanding what each syntax in a html page is for is more important than memorizing it.
>. The components include;
      1]] The doctype: opens up the html document
      2]] The HTML tag and lang attribute: the former is the root tag of the document, while the latter is specifies the language
      of the document.
      3]] Character coding: this tells the browser how to parse the information contained within.
      Its a void element hence doesn't require a closing tag.
      Its value should always be <meta charset="utf-8" />


   ### Sensible Approach to HTML Markup

>. Note clarity in authoring code should trump brevity.
>. Despite HTML5's looser syntax, its good habit to checkup your markup for any basic human errors such as
missing or mismatched tags, missing alt attributes, incorrectly nested elements among others. 
>. Use https://validator.w3.org/ for validating your code.

>. The anchor tag is the tag used to link from the document a user is on to another document elsewhere
on the internet, or another point in the same document.
>. Unlike the old html the new HTML allows us to wrap various elements as a group rather than individual elements.
  
    // Example: <a href = "index.html">
                    <h2>The home page</h2>
                    <p>This paragraph also links to the home page</p>
                    <img src="home-image.png" alt="A rendering of the home page" />
                </a>


>. A limitation to the a tag is that you cant wrap one tag within another tag or other interactive elements such as buttons and you
cant wrap a form in a tag either.



#### New Sematic Elements in HTML5 ####

>.Semantics: a branch of linguistics and logic concerned with meaning.
>. Knowing that elements exist to convey a certain meaning is a huge part os making accessible websites and applications.
 
   **** Categories ****
   1. Sectioning Elements: These are the kind of elements which are used for headers, footer and sidebar areas. 
   2. Grouping Elements: These are used as wrap associated elements. e.g paragraphs, blockquotes and content
   3. Text-level Elements:  These are used to designate particulars e.g bold, italic text or code.



        Part A - ### Sectioning Elements ###
From: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-main-element
and responsive web design book

     1]] The <main> element 

>. This element reps the dominant content of the document.
>.The main content area of a document includes content that is unique to that document and excludes
content that is repeated across a set of documents such as site navigation links, copyright info, site logos,
and banners and search forms(unless the document or application's main function is that of a search form.)
>. There shouldn't be more that one main on each page that doesn't have the hidden attribute specified.
>. Also it shouldn't be used as a descendant of child elements of some of the other semantic HTML elements such as 
article, aside, header, footer or nav.


    2]]  The <section> element 

>. This element is used to define a generic section of a document or application.
>. This element is not meant for styling purposes, hence if you need to wrap an element to nearly style it then a div would suffice.
>. A use case is it is used in wrapping elements for visual components. It provides a simple way to see the beginning and the end of components in the markup.
>. A general rule is that section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline.
>. Example of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box or the numbered sections of a thesis.
>. A web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, new items and contact information.


   3]] The <nav> element 

>. The nav element is used to wrap major navigational links to other pages within the same page.
>. If you usually mark up your navigational elements with an unordered list (ul) and a bunch of list tags (li), you
may be better served with a nav and a number of nested a tags instead.

    4]] The <article> element

>. The article element is used to wrap a self-contained piece of content.
>. Example of content that should be wrapped with an article element include forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, 
a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content

  
   5]] The <aside> element

>. The aside element is used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it.
>. Practically often used for sidebars, or content in a little tip about a related subject in a blog post.
>. Other examples that would be suitable include: pull quotes, advertising and a group of navigation elements.
>. Hence anything not directly related to the main content would work well in an aside.


   6]]  The  <header> element

>. The header element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.
>. The header element is intended to usually contain a heading (an h1-h6 element or an hgroup element), but not necessarily.
>. The header element can also be used to wrap a section's table of content, a search form, or relevant logos.
Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, 
    <address> or another <header> element.
>. Note you can have a header inside every section on your page.


    7]] The <footer> element

>. Typically, a footer contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents,
copyright data e.t.c.
>. Note the footer element is not itself sectioning content: it doesn't introduce a new section.
>. Like headers, we can use footers several times if need be: example a footer of a blog but also a footer within a blog post
article on the same blog.

>. Note the contact info for the author or editor of a section belongs in an address element possibly itself inside a footer.



            ### The HTML5 outline algorithm ###

>. The reality is that search engines and the like make no use of HTML5 outliner at present, hence a pragmatic viewpoint is to continue
thinking of headings in terms of the whole document. As this will make your documents easier to read for search engines and also aid assistive technology to infer the correct meaning.

     
    >>> A note on h1-h6 and the <hgroup> element

>. The use of h1-h6 tags to mark up groups of headings and their associated sub-headings/taglines is discouraged.
    
    // Example: <h1>Scones:</h1>
                <h2>The most resplendent of snacks</h2>

>. Instead try and reserve h1-h6 elements for when sections of content require a distinct heading.

>. Hence to group content we should use hgroup element like so:
      <hgroup>
        <h1>Scones:</h1>
        <P>The most resplendent of snacks</p>
        </hgroup>

>. The hgroup element represents a heading and related content. The element may be used to group 
an h1–h6 element with one or more p elements containing content representing a subheading, alternative title, or tagline.

          PART B ### GROUPING ELEMENTS ###

      1]] The <div> Element

>. This element is widely used because it is opinion-less, coveys nothing.
>. You should opt for a div as the last resort, as it is the element to use when you can think of nothing.


      2]] The <p> Element

>. Used to mark-up a paragraph.
>. For non-specific text, the p element is definitely a better choice than a div.

      3]] The <blockquote> Element

>. This element is used to markup text that is quoted from somewhere else.

      4]] The <figure> and <figcaption> elements

>. Used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
>. While the figcaption provides the means to add some text supporting the visuals.
>. Note, while we should always provide text in the alt attribute of an img tag to support assistive technology or to mitigate
the problem if an image fails to load, it isn't a requirement to provide a figcaption with a figure.
>. The figcaption is added if you want to add a visual description alongside the visuals.

      5]] The <details> and <summary> elements

      6]] The <address> element

>. This is used explicitly for marking up contact information for its nearest article or body ancestor.
>. Note: the address element must not be used to represent arbitrary addresses e.g postal addresses, unless those addresses are relevant contact information- the
p element is appropriate for marking up postal addresses in general.

          PART C ### HTML TEXT-LEVEL SEMANTICS###

>. These are elements which are used to mark up individual words, letters and symbols to provide explicit meaning as to the intent.

>. Most common and useful include;

        1]] The <span> element

>. This is the text-level equivalent of a div. Its unopinionated and good fo when you merely want to wrap
a text in an element for styling purposes.

        2]] The <b> element

>. The <b> tag specifies bold text without any extra importance.
>. The element is not intended to be used to surround large groups of markup; use div for that.
>. Because it was historically used for bold text, you have to reset the font-weight in CSS. so that the btag does not appear bold.
     // Example:
          b{
            font-weight: normal
          }

>. According to the HTML5 specifications, the <b> tag should be used as the last resort when no other tag is more appropriate.
>. The specification states that headings should be denoted with the <h1> to <h6> tags, emphasized text should be denoted with the <em> tag,
     important text should be denoted with the <strong> tag, and marked/highlighted text should be denoted with the <mark> tag 

        3]] The strong Element

>. This element is useful when you want to emphasize something for strength, urgency or importance.

        4]]  The <em> Element

>. The em element represents stress emphasis of its content

        5]] The <i> Element

>. A span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner
indicating a different quality of text.
>. Typically content inside it is in italics.
>. The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, et
>. Use the element when there is not a more appropriate semantic element such as:
          1]] <em> (emphasized text)
          2]] <mark> (marked/highlighted text)
          3]] <strong> (important text)
          4]] <cite> (the title of a work)
          5]] <dfn> (a definition term)

            ### Obsolete HTML feature ###

>. Be aware of two camps of obsolete features in HTML. That is
         1]] Conforming: These will work, but will generate warning in  validators - Avoid them!!
         2]] Non-conforming: These may still render in certain browsers but they may not - not guaranteed.


           ### WCAG accessibility conformance and WAI-ARIA for more accessible web applications ###

>. WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

>. WCAG exists to provide a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations and
government internationally.

>>>> Source: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/

>. WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications).

>. The principal aim of WAI-ARAI is to solve the problem of making dynamic content on a web page accessible.
   It provides a means for describing roles, states and properties for custom widgets such as dynamic sections in web applications.
   So that they are recognizable and usable by assistive technology users. e.g blind people 

>>>>> Source: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/


>. Note the best way you can aid assistive technologies is to use the correct elements where possible.
>. That is e.g using a header element rather than a <div class="Header">

           ### Embedding Media in HTML5 ###

           >>> Adding video and audio in HTML
 // <video src="myVideo.mp4"></video>
>. HTML allows a single video tag or audio tag for audio. Additionally it is possible to insert text between the opening and closing tag to inform users where there is a problem.

>. Additional attributes you can add include: the height and width.
    // <video src="myVideo.mp4" width="640" height="480">
        If you're reading this either the video didn't load or your browser is
        waaaayyyyyy old!
       </video>

>. To add the default playback controls we have to add the controls attribute.
      // Example with controls and autoplay attributes added.

      <video src="myVideo.mp4" width="640" height="480" controls autoplay>
           If you're reading this either the video didn't load or your browser is wayy old!
      </video>

>. Other attributes include;
     preload to control the preloading of media, loop to repeat the video, and poster to define a poster for the video-the image
     that shows while a video is loading.
     // Example:
         <video
            src="myVideo.mp4"
            width="640"
            height="480"
            controls
            autoplay
            muted
            preload="auto"
            loop
            poster="myVideoPoster.png"
        >
        If you're reading this either the video didn't load or your browser is wayy old!
      </video>


             ### Providing Alternate Media Sources ###

>. The source tag enables us to provide alternate sources for the media.
>. The type attribute tells the browser the MIME type of the resource. If you fail to specify the browser will fetch the content and try and play anyway.
>. But if available always add the MIME type.
        // Example
            <video
                width="640"
                height="480"
                controls
                preload="auto"
                loop
                poster="myVideoPoster.png"
            >
            <source src="video/myVideo.sp8" type="video/super8" />
            <source src="video/myVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            <p>
                <b>Download Video:</b>
                MP4 Format
                <a href="myVideo.mp4">"MP4"</a>
            </p>
        </video>


                ### Audio and Video tags work almost identically ###

>. The audio tag works similarly as the video tag, with the same attributes, that is excluding height, width and poster.
>. The key difference is that audio has no playback area for visible content.


                ### Responsive HTML5 video and iframes ###

>. To fix HTML video embedding, we can simply remove height and width attributes in the markup.
       // Example:
            if width="640" height="480"
             video {
                max-width: 100%;
                height: auto;
             }
>. Note, this works well for files that we might be hosting locally, hence doesnt solve the problem of videos embedded within an iframe(e.g YouTube, vimeo, et al).

>. To solve this problem , we can use the https://embedresponsively.com/ and paste your iframe URL in, it will spit out a simple chunk of code into your page.
             // Example:



               ### The modern way to embed iframes and keep aspect ratio ###

>. If you only need to support more modern browsers, you can set the aspect ratio of something like an iframe with the aspect-ratio property.
>. For an iframe we want to keep it at 16:9 ratio such as YouTube video.
            // Example:
            .iframe-16-9 {
                aspect-ratio: 16/9;
                max-width: 100%;
            }

>. The aspect-ratio property is not limited to iframes- as you can use it on any box in CSS that ne wants to maintain certain proportions.
         
                ### The Loading Attribute ###

               ### The <dialog> Element ###
