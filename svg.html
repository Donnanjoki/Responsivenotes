CHAPTER 10 - SVG I(Scalable Vector Graphics)
******************

>. SVG aids in responsive web design and providing pin-sharp and future-proof graphical assets for all screen resolutions.

>. With graphics saved in JPEG, GIF or PNG the shortcomings limit these images definitions.

>. SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics in XML [XML10]. SVG allows for three
types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (for paths consisting of straight lines and curves),
images, and text.

>. SVG allows two-dimensional images to be described in code as vector points, hence these points can scale to any size without loss of fidelity.
>. Also in terms of data SVGs tend to be tiny compared to JPEG, GIFs or PNG file.


### The root SVG element ###
>. The root SVG element has attributes for width, height and viewBox.
    <svg width="198px" height="188px" viewBox="0 0 198 188"

>> The width and height of the SVG effectively create a viewport. 
>. While the viewBox defines the coordinate system in which all the shapes of the SVG are governed.
   >> You can think of the viewBox values 0 0 198 188 as describing the top-left and
     bottom-right areas of a rectangle. The first two values, known technically as min-x and min-y,
     describe the top-left corner, while the second two, known technically as width and height, de-
     scribe the bottom-right corner. 

     >> Having the viewBox attribute allows you to do things like zoom an image in or out


   ### The defs tag ###
      // Example: <defs></defs>

>. Note, despite being empty, they are an important element as they are used to store definitions of all manner of reusable content
such as gradients, symbols, paths and more.

    ### SVG shapes ###
>. SVGs have a number of ready-made shapes such as
      1] path
      2] rect
      3] circle
      4] ellipse
      5] line
      6] polyline
      7] polygon



















































































    ### SVG Implementation Tips ###

 1]] If you have no need to animate your SVGs, opt for an image sprite of your assets or a data
   URI style sheet. It’s far easier to provide fallback assets and they almost always perform
   better from a performance perspective

2]] Automate as many steps in the asset creation process as possible; this reduces human
    error and produces predictable results faster.

3]] To insert static SVGs in a project, pick a single delivery mechanism and stick to it (image
    sprite, data URI, or inline). It can become a burden to produce some assets one way and
    some another and maintain the various implementations.

4]] There is no easy “one size fits all” choice with SVG animation. For occasional and simple
   animations, use CSS. For complex interactive or timeline-style animations, lean on a
   proven library such as GreenSock. Or, look at using the JavaScript Web Animations API.


   >. Note: These are just guides, not gospel. There will be times when you need to make a choice that may
           seem counter-intuitive to conventional wisdom. But at least if you have taken in the details here,
           you will be able to make informed choices when it comes to working with SVG.
