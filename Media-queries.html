 Chapter 3: Media Queries and Container Queries

>. Media queries allows us to target specific CSS styles depending on the capabilities of a device.
>. We can change the way content is displayed based on things such as:
        a]] Viewport width
        b]] screen aspect ratio
        c]] orientation (landscape or portrait)


    ### The meta viewport tag ###

>. The meta tag was introduced by Apple in 2007, and its purpose was to provide a way for web pages to communicate to mobile browsers how they would like the web browsers to render the page.
>. Example: 
     <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=2.0,width=device-width" />

       // breakdown:
           1. the name "viewport" tell the browser this tag is dealing with the viewport.
           2. the content="initial-scale=2.0" states to scale the content to twice its size.
           3. the width=device-width part tells the browser that the width of the page should be equal to the device-width

>.The meta tag can also be used to control the amount a user can zoom in and out of a page.
   // Example: Allows users to go as large as three times the device and small as half the device width.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=3, minimum scale=0.5"
        />

        // You can also disable users form zooming at all:
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"
        />

>. Note zooming is an important accessibility requirement for users with reduced visual acuity, hence do no add feature "user-scalable-no".

   // Example:
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />

>. In the above example the scale is changed to 1.0, meaning that the mobile browser will render the page at 100% percent of the width of all the supported mobile browsers.


   ### Why media queries are needed for a responsive web design ###

>. A media query consists of a media type and zero or more expressions that check for the conditions of
particular media features. Among the media features that can be used in media queries are ‘width’,
‘height’, and ‘color’. By using media queries, presentations can be tailored to a specific range of output
devices without changing the content itself

>. Media queries are thought as the basic conditional logic for css.


     ### Basic conditional logic in CSS ###

>. True programming languages all have some facility in which one of two or more possible situations is catered for.
>. This is usually taken care of by some conditional logic known as control flow - typified by an if/else statement.
