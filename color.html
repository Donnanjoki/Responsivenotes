CHAPTER 7: CSS COLOR
********************

## Color concepts and terminology ##

>. Color Space is a mathematical representation of colors.
    >> For the print world there's the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black, while fot the web world there is the sRGB which is the s
     standard color space on the web).

>. Gamut - refers to the range of possible colors that a device can display.


## The current state of CSS Color ##
       As of 2022
1] All monitors and browsers can display sRGB colors and there are various syntaxes to describe them in CSS:
    hex (e.g, #000), rgb(0,0,0), hsl(0 0% 0%).

2] There are also colors that many modern monitors can display but not all browsers currently
support. This category of colors is typically dealt with in CSS with the color() function
to pass a custom color space (typically display-P3) to CSS, or using LCH/Lab.

3] There is a category of colors that humans can see, yet few (if any?) monitors can display.
CSS can now describe such colors with LCH/Lab.

4] Right now in 2022, only safari browser supports lch(), lab() and color().






RGB Color
>. RED, GREEN and BLUE 

  // Example:
.redness {
    color: #fe0208;
}
<note first two digits are red value in hexadecimal, the next tw0 are green and the last two are blue.>

or representing the same color in RGB functional notation in values range 0 - 255

.redness {
    color: rgb(255, 2, 8);
}


HSL Color (HSL works on a 360 degrees color wheel)
>. HUE, SATURATION and LIGHTNESS
>. Young Guys Can Be Messy Rascals : yellow is at 60°, green is at 120°, cyan is at 180°, blue is at 240°, magenta is at 300°, and finally,
red is at 360°.

// Example:
   .redness {
    color: hsl(359, 99%. 50%);
   }


### Alpha Channels ###
>. This controls the transparency or opacity of color.
>. For that need with hex, RGB and HSL, its possible to define the alpha channel.

     A]] Alpha with hex
     >. Here you can define the alpha channel with a four-digit or eight-digit syntax.
          // example:
          background-color: #0007;
                 or
          background-color: #00000077;

## Alpha with functional notation ###
>. Using the functional notation, yoi can define an alpha chanel like so with HSL.
     .redness-alpha {
        color: hsl(359, 99%, 50%, 0.5);
     }
             or
    .redness-alpha {
        color: hsl(359, 99%, 50%, 50%);
    }

>. For RGB syntax follow this convention;
   .redness-alpha-rgba {
    color: rgb(254, 2, 8, 0.8);
   }

>. With new css capabilities we can now do this;
     .redness-alpha-rgb {
        color: rgb(254, 2, 8, 0.8);
     }


     ## Space-separated functional color notation##

>. Unless you need to support old browsers, you can, and probably should, write colors using the
newer space-separated syntax.

>. In the space-separated color-values, if you need to add an alpha channel, add a forward slash (/) before adding the alpha as either
a decimal value or a percentage.

  // Example:
     .redness-alpha-rgba {
        color: rgb(254 2 8 /0.8);
     }

             or

    .redness-alpha-rgba {
        color: rgb(254 2 8 / 80%);
    }

NOTE:: It used to be necessary to define RGB or HSL colors with an alpha channel using the
functional rgba() or hsla() formats (note the appended a for alpha). However,
that’s no longer needed unless you need to support a very old browser.


NOTE:; There's no real best color format just best format for a particular job.
>. You can use certain formats to get certain style of gradients or the typical hex values for everyday use.


### @media (color-gamut) media query ###

>. This media query lets us test for the support of certain colors on the host device.
   // Example: @media (color-gamut: rec2020) {
    .thing {
        color: color(display-p3 0 1 1);
    }
   }


      ### LCH with the lch()function ###

>. Lab/lCH is capable are designed to be able to express all of human vision, even if our monitors are currently not capable of doing that.
>. LCH is an abbreviation of Lightness, Chroma, Hue. It is the same color space as Lab, but using
polar coordinates. 
   >> polar coordinates is a way of describing how far something is from a reference point.

   // Example: background-color: lch (50% 132 43);

>. Like the other functional color notations, you can add a forward slash (/) and then add an alpha
channel as a value between 0 and 1 or a percentage

>. Takeaway: Arguably one of the more important things to take from LCH/Lab is that the Lightness is designed
to look the same across different colors, something that the lightness of HSL does not do. 



  ## Fallback for older browsers ##

>. To simply provide a fallback for older browsers, just write the standard format first and then the newer syntax straight after.

// Example; 
  >. So if we wanted that “super green” P3 green but know that we have a nice P3 version for browsers
and hardware that don’t support P3 (note I’m also using the older syntax with commas for the
sake of even older browsers):
       background-color: rgb(0, 255,0);
       background-color: color(display-p3 0 1 0);

       or 

>. We could use @supports version
   @supports (color(display-p3 0 1 0)) {
    background-color: color(display-p3 0 1 0);
   }


   ### The color-mix() function ###

>. This function lets us specify a color space to mix in, and then two colors to mix in that color space.
  // Example;
     .mix {
        background-color: color-mix(in lch gold 50%, orange);
     }



### The color-contrast() function ###

>. The color-contrast() function lets you specify a color, then at least another two colors, to effectively compete for the title of “Most
Contrasting Color.” That’s not a real thing by the way, but it does mean a huge difference to day-to-day life as a developer trying to ensure you create suitably contrasting sites for accessibility.

// Example:
    .header-text {
        background-color: #333;
        color: color-contrast(#333 vs #666, #545454,#777, #f90);
    }

>. In the above example; we set the background to a dark gray (#333) to test the contrast against. Then we
use the vs keyword to separate the colors that are going to be tested as the color with the highest
contrast against that first color. Note that currently, in the experimental version of the syntax,
you need a comma after each extra color you want to test against.
>. The winner is orange with the hex code of #f90


>. If you are trying to achieve AA WCAG accessibility compliance, you can pass a target contrast ration like so;
    // Example:

         .header-text {
            background-color: #333;
            color: color-contrast(#333 vs #666, #545454, #777, #f90 to 4.5);
         }
  
                 or

        .header-text {
            background-color: #333;
            color: color-contrast(#333 vs #666, #545454, #777. #f90 to AA)
        }

>. The AA here means a contrast ratio of 4.5:1, which is the ratio required for AA WCAG accessibility with text contrast. 
>. Note: There is no implementation that currently supports the to keyword and passing a contrast of AA or AAA; instead, it only 
supports the number value.

>. This function comes in handy when you want to use a bunch of pre-defined colors, while addressing accessibility concerns.
